He's been fighting on his own
since he broke with the Rebellion.

215
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,602
His militancy has caused the Alliance

a great many problems.

in Jedha. A pilot.

He's been held by Saw Gerrera.

He's claiming the Emperor
is creating a weapon

with the power to destroy entire planets.

224

he was sent by your father.

is to authenticate the pilot's story.

229

234
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,842
we're hoping that he will
help us locate your father

235
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,651
and return him
to the Senate for testimony.

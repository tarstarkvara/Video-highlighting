1
00:00:38,921 --> 00:00:40,921
<i>The open ocean.</i>

2
00:00:42,361 --> 00:00:46,561
<i>It covers more than half
the surface of our planet.</i>

3
00:00:46,641 --> 00:00:48,361
<i>Yet, for the most part</i>

4
00:00:48,441 --> 00:00:52,561
<i>it's a watery desert, empty of life.</i>

5
00:00:56,121 --> 00:01:00,361
<i>Hunters here spend their lives
in a constant search</i>

6
00:01:00,441 --> 00:01:03,241
<i>for scarce and elusive prey.</i>

7
00:01:17,961 --> 00:01:21,921
<i>Remarkably, this seemingly
barren wilderness</i>

8
00:01:22,001 --> 00:01:26,041
<i>is home to the largest hunter
of them all.</i>

9
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:32,041
<i>The blue whale.</i>

10
00:01:41,761 --> 00:01:46,281
<i>Weighing 200 tonnes and 30 metres long,</i>

11
00:01:46,361 --> 00:01:50,161
<i>these are the biggest animals ever
to have lived.</i>

12
00:02:03,521 --> 00:02:06,321
<i>Despite their immense size</i>

13
00:02:06,401 --> 00:02:09,361
<i>blue whales are one of the most
streamlined</i>

14
00:02:09,441 --> 00:02:13,481
<i>and energy-efficient of all swimmers.</i>

15
00:02:23,401 --> 00:02:26,961
<i>Their food is so scarce
and widely spread</i>

16
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:30,601
<i>that blue whales
must journey across whole oceans</i>

17
00:02:31,681 --> 00:02:34,521
<i>just to find a single meal.</i>

18
00:02:41,201 --> 00:02:46,721
<i>They can travel over a hundred miles
a day, for weeks at a time.</i>

19
00:02:59,401 --> 00:03:04,441
<i>The ocean's largest animal
feeds on one of its smallest.</i>

20
00:03:06,201 --> 00:03:09,921
<i>Krill, small shrimp-like crustaceans.</i>

21
00:03:17,121 --> 00:03:21,121
<i>Opening its gigantic mouth
takes so much effort</i>

22
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:26,081
<i>that they only do so when the swarms
of krill are rich and concentrated.</i>

23
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:35,361
<i>The krill here is too scattered,</i>

24
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:37,921
<i>not even worth slowing down for.</i>

25
00:04:10,281 --> 00:04:15,721
<i>This blue whale's lonely search for food
must go on.</i>

26
00:04:22,121 --> 00:04:27,121
<i>Out here feeding opportunities
are always few and far between.</i>

27
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,721
<i>And they never last long.</i>

28
00:04:36,681 --> 00:04:39,041
<i>Prey is devoured within minutes.</i>

29
00:04:49,401 --> 00:04:54,241
<i>When it's all over the hunters
must resume their endless search.</i>

30
00:04:58,321 --> 00:05:02,121
<i>Frigate birds,
the pirates of the high seas.</i>

31
00:05:03,561 --> 00:05:06,881
<i>Soaring effortlessly
on the gentle trade winds,</i>

32
00:05:06,961 --> 00:05:10,521
<i>they can scan vast tracts
of ocean for food.</i>

33
00:05:13,441 --> 00:05:17,601
<i>Frigates must be so lightweight
that they can't afford the heavy oils</i>

34
00:05:17,681 --> 00:05:20,841
<i>that waterproof the plumage
of other sea birds.</i>

35
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:24,041
<i>So getting wet would be lethal.</i>

36
00:05:25,761 --> 00:05:30,121
<i>This may seem an impossible limitation
for a seafaring hunter.</i>

37
00:05:30,201 --> 00:05:34,881
<i>But frigate birds overcome this handicap
with help from others.</i>

38
00:05:43,321 --> 00:05:44,521
<i>Dorado.</i>

39
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:49,961
<i>One of the fastest
and most voracious of ocean predators.</i>

40
00:05:52,921 --> 00:05:56,521
<i>They patrol close to the surface,
searching for prey.</i>

41
00:06:06,401 --> 00:06:10,441
<i>Little fish try to hide amidst
the undulating swell of the ocean,</i>

42
00:06:10,521 --> 00:06:12,481
<i>the only cover there is.</i>

43
00:06:19,481 --> 00:06:21,641
<i>It's a game of hide and seek</i>

44
00:06:21,721 --> 00:06:23,961
<i>played out amongst the waves.</i>

45
00:06:27,841 --> 00:06:29,521
<i>Their cover blown,</i>

46
00:06:31,521 --> 00:06:33,561
<i>escape seems impossible.</i>

47
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:45,601
<i>But these particular fish
have a unique ability.</i>

48
00:07:00,161 --> 00:07:02,321
<i>They're flying fish.</i>

49
00:07:24,801 --> 00:07:27,241
<i>With an extra thrust from their tails,</i>

50
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:29,681
<i>the flying fish get airborne
once more.</i>

51
00:07:38,321 --> 00:07:42,161
<i>With a good wind,
they can glide for hundreds of metres.</i>

52
00:07:59,641 --> 00:08:03,481
<i>But this is just what the frigate birds
have been waiting for.</i>

53
00:08:07,961 --> 00:08:09,521
<i>When frigates join the hunt,</i>

54
00:08:09,601 --> 00:08:13,761
<i>the flying fish are literally
caught between the devil</i>

55
00:08:15,801 --> 00:08:17,801
<i>and the deep blue sea.</i>

56
00:08:37,241 --> 00:08:39,841
<i>If the flying fish get too much lift</i>

57
00:08:39,921 --> 00:08:42,241
<i>they become easy prey for the frigates.</i>

58
00:08:57,241 --> 00:09:00,401
<i>If they dive to evade attack from above,</i>

59
00:09:05,121 --> 00:09:08,041
<i>they could fall into the mouths
of the dorado.</i>

60
00:09:49,001 --> 00:09:50,961
<i>With the help of the dorado</i>

61
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:55,321
<i>the wily frigate bird has
become a flying fish specialist,</i>

62
00:09:56,441 --> 00:09:59,281
<i>and without getting
a single feather wet.</i>

63
00:10:05,721 --> 00:10:10,481
<i>Not all open ocean hunters are able
to travel in search of their food...</i>

64
00:10:12,241 --> 00:10:16,841
<i>Some have no choice,
but wait for a meal to come to them.</i>

65
00:10:21,001 --> 00:10:23,281
<i>A mat of sargassum weed</i>

66
00:10:23,361 --> 00:10:25,961
<i>drifts in the middle of the Atlantic.</i>

67
00:10:31,601 --> 00:10:35,961
<i>Sargassum is the only seaweed
to live entirely at the surface,</i>

68
00:10:36,841 --> 00:10:39,321
<i>it never attaches to the sea floor.</i>

69
00:10:43,841 --> 00:10:46,161
<i>This floating tangle of fronds</i>

70
00:10:46,241 --> 00:10:49,921
<i>is home to a surprising open
ocean predator.</i>

71
00:10:50,601 --> 00:10:52,801
<i>The sargassum fish.</i>

72
00:10:56,761 --> 00:11:00,201
<i>Every part of his body mimics the weed.</i>

73
00:11:02,641 --> 00:11:05,881
<i>His fins are more suited
to walking than swimming.</i>

74
00:11:07,841 --> 00:11:10,521
<i>In fact, he can barely swim at all.</i>

75
00:11:12,921 --> 00:11:17,961
<i>He will spend his entire life
marooned on this weedy raft.</i>

76
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:29,281
<i>This sargassum fish must lie in wait</i>

77
00:11:29,361 --> 00:11:32,641
<i>for those seeking shelter
amongst the weed.</i>

78
00:11:44,961 --> 00:11:48,601
<i>Unfortunately,
his mat is empty for now,</i>

79
00:11:50,681 --> 00:11:54,961
<i>but at least he's not wasting
valuable energy searching for food.</i>

80
00:12:01,241 --> 00:12:03,361
<i>In the featureless ocean,</i>

81
00:12:03,441 --> 00:12:07,641
<i>these mats are much sought
after sanctuary for juvenile fish.</i>

82
00:12:24,921 --> 00:12:26,201
<i>At last...</i>

83
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:30,241
<i>his first opportunity for weeks.</i>

84
00:12:37,081 --> 00:12:38,881
<i>He must get closer.</i>

85
00:12:39,961 --> 00:12:44,921
<i>He can only strike when he's within
a few centimetres of his prey.</i>

86
00:12:55,121 --> 00:12:59,641
<i>Trusting his perfect camouflage,
he hides in the weed.</i>

87
00:13:05,161 --> 00:13:06,441
<i>Patience.</i>

88
00:13:11,881 --> 00:13:13,841
<i>Still not close enough.</i>

89
00:13:25,481 --> 00:13:28,361
<i>Hunger is clearly getting
the better of him.</i>

90
00:13:41,241 --> 00:13:43,321
<i>Surely this time.</i>

91
00:13:47,361 --> 00:13:48,681
<i>Blown it.</i>

92
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:54,121
<i>It may be weeks
before he gets another chance.</i>

93
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:12,041
<i>The open ocean is so vast</i>

94
00:14:12,121 --> 00:14:15,001
<i>that some hunters
can only find enough prey</i>

95
00:14:15,081 --> 00:14:17,041
<i>by searching as a team.</i>

96
00:14:31,281 --> 00:14:35,881
<i>Dolphins live in highly sophisticated
social groups.</i>

97
00:14:44,561 --> 00:14:48,921
<i>Working together they can cover
a huge area of ocean.</i>

98
00:14:53,441 --> 00:14:56,561
<i>These are spinner dolphins.</i>

99
00:14:58,361 --> 00:15:01,921
<i>Why they make these twisting leaps
is still debatable.</i>

100
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:04,641
<i>Perhaps it's a form of communication.</i>

101
00:15:08,481 --> 00:15:10,961
<i>Or perhaps it’s just fun.</i>

102
00:15:12,961 --> 00:15:15,321
<i>Small groups sometimes come together,</i>

103
00:15:15,401 --> 00:15:18,841
<i>forming super-pods
five thousand strong.</i>

104
00:15:25,361 --> 00:15:28,001
<i>And these are on the hunt.</i>

105
00:15:36,921 --> 00:15:41,121
<i>Spinners are the most vocal
of all the dolphins.</i>

106
00:15:43,921 --> 00:15:46,881
<i>They use echolocation, a kind of sonar,</i>

107
00:15:46,961 --> 00:15:48,681
<i>to find their prey.</i>

108
00:15:49,801 --> 00:15:53,201
<i>Each hunter sends out a series of clicks</i>

109
00:15:54,241 --> 00:15:56,881
<i>and then listens for returning echoes.</i>

110
00:15:59,561 --> 00:16:03,601
<i>Allowing them to scan for distant prey,
hundreds of metres away.</i>

111
00:16:10,161 --> 00:16:13,521
<i>The super-pod spreads out
into a wide hunting line</i>

112
00:16:13,601 --> 00:16:15,401
<i>up to a mile across,</i>

113
00:16:16,721 --> 00:16:19,361
<i>producing a wall of sound.</i>

114
00:16:32,081 --> 00:16:35,161
<i>They're searching
for their favourite prey.</i>

115
00:16:37,761 --> 00:16:39,201
<i>Lantern fish.</i>

116
00:16:39,281 --> 00:16:43,121
<i>They are the most numerous fish
on the planet.</i>

117
00:16:44,681 --> 00:16:49,241
<i>But these small fish spend most of their
time down in the deep ocean,</i>

118
00:16:49,321 --> 00:16:51,721
<i>way beyond the reach of dolphins.</i>

119
00:16:52,801 --> 00:16:55,281
<i>It's only when they come up
to the surface to feed</i>

120
00:16:55,361 --> 00:16:57,201
<i>that they become prey.</i>

121
00:17:00,841 --> 00:17:02,281
<i>Once they've found a shoal</i>

122
00:17:02,361 --> 00:17:05,401
<i>the dolphins use their sonar
in a different way.</i>

123
00:17:07,601 --> 00:17:10,681
<i>They stun the fish with loud blasts,</i>

124
00:17:10,761 --> 00:17:12,841
<i>then simply gather them up.</i>

125
00:17:28,121 --> 00:17:31,761
<i>As they feed, the dolphins work
the underside of the shoal</i>

126
00:17:31,841 --> 00:17:35,921
<i>to stop their prey from escaping
back into the safety of the deep.</i>

127
00:17:56,201 --> 00:18:00,801
<i>Within a few minutes,
all that's left is a shower of scales</i>

128
00:18:00,881 --> 00:18:03,721
<i>drifting downwards to the ocean depths.</i>

129
00:18:16,241 --> 00:18:22,321
<i>The deep ocean is by far the largest
habitat for life on earth.</i>

130
00:18:23,441 --> 00:18:27,481
<i>And home to some of the most
bizarre hunters of all.</i>

131
00:18:31,161 --> 00:18:35,201
<i>Down here, food is much scarcer
than at the surface,</i>

132
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:38,321
<i>so deep-sea predators
must do all they can</i>

133
00:18:38,401 --> 00:18:40,361
<i>to save precious energy.</i>

134
00:18:49,841 --> 00:18:53,161
<i>Waiting patiently, a viper fish,</i>

135
00:18:53,561 --> 00:18:56,361
<i>special light-producing organs
on its head</i>

136
00:18:57,121 --> 00:18:59,721
<i>entice prey towards fearsome teeth.</i>

137
00:19:04,921 --> 00:19:08,921
<i>Strange, yet deadly,
jelly hunters also live here.</i>

138
00:19:11,601 --> 00:19:13,481
<i>Most simply drift,</i>

139
00:19:13,561 --> 00:19:17,281
<i>trailing tentacles
loaded with lethal stings.</i>

140
00:19:22,921 --> 00:19:26,441
<i>Others, propelled by lines
of beating hairs,</i>

141
00:19:26,521 --> 00:19:28,921
<i>glide gently through the darkness.</i>

142
00:19:44,361 --> 00:19:48,841
<i>Beroe, the top deep-sea jelly predator.</i>

143
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:57,841
<i>They actively hunt other jellies.</i>

144
00:20:00,361 --> 00:20:02,121
<i>Like this ctenophore.</i>

145
00:20:16,641 --> 00:20:19,521
<i>To grasp its gelatinous prey,</i>

146
00:20:19,601 --> 00:20:23,521
<i>beroe has special teeth-like
spikes in its mouth.</i>

147
00:20:38,361 --> 00:20:42,721
<i>Many deep-sea hunters
just hang in the abyss,</i>

148
00:20:43,321 --> 00:20:44,881
<i>saving their energy,</i>

149
00:20:45,721 --> 00:20:48,361
<i>luring their prey to come to them.</i>

150
00:20:54,521 --> 00:20:56,081
<i>Chiroteuthis.</i>

151
00:20:57,601 --> 00:21:03,361
<i>This deep-sea squid fishes for prey
using long sticky tentacles.</i>

152
00:21:03,881 --> 00:21:05,921
<i>Each has a glowing lure</i>

153
00:21:06,001 --> 00:21:08,921
<i>pulsing to attract passing prey.</i>

154
00:21:25,481 --> 00:21:30,161
<i>A gentle twitch adds to the temptation.</i>

155
00:21:57,601 --> 00:22:02,681
<i>Down here in the darkness
this meal is a rare bonanza.</i>

156
00:22:10,921 --> 00:22:14,761
<i>The open ocean may be
a vast blue desert,</i>

157
00:22:16,361 --> 00:22:20,001
<i>but like all deserts it has oases.</i>

158
00:22:28,081 --> 00:22:31,601
<i>Scattered widely
across this endless space</i>

159
00:22:31,681 --> 00:22:33,961
<i>are thousands of small islands.</i>

160
00:22:38,721 --> 00:22:41,881
<i>These are the summits
of underwater mountains,</i>

161
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:45,481
<i>which rise up from the sea floor
many miles below.</i>

162
00:22:52,841 --> 00:22:56,721
<i>The sea mounts deflect deep
ocean currents upwards,</i>

163
00:22:56,801 --> 00:22:59,681
<i>forcing nutrient laden water
to the surface.</i>

164
00:23:07,321 --> 00:23:11,601
<i>A busy oasis in the emptiness
of the big blue.</i>

165
00:23:32,561 --> 00:23:35,641
<i>For potential prey
there's plenty of shelter</i>

166
00:23:35,721 --> 00:23:37,401
<i>amongst the coral.</i>

167
00:23:38,921 --> 00:23:42,521
<i>And in the caves that are hidden
beneath the reef itself.</i>

168
00:23:53,561 --> 00:23:55,801
<i>Small fish take refuge here,</i>

169
00:23:55,881 --> 00:23:58,361
<i>out of the reach
of most of their predators.</i>

170
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:02,441
<i>But not all.</i>

171
00:24:04,521 --> 00:24:05,801
<i>Lion fish.</i>

172
00:24:11,641 --> 00:24:13,801
<i>They're not built for speed...</i>

173
00:24:13,881 --> 00:24:17,601
<i>Success here depends on
delicate maneuvering.</i>

174
00:24:19,761 --> 00:24:23,161
<i>Their strategy is to hide
in plain sight,</i>

175
00:24:23,241 --> 00:24:26,841
<i>lulling their prey
into a false sense of security.</i>

176
00:24:34,721 --> 00:24:37,521
<i>The lion fish’s stripes
are visually confusing,</i>

177
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:41,361
<i>making it difficult for their prey
to judge how close it is.</i>

178
00:24:55,281 --> 00:24:57,841
<i>Using its extravagant fins</i>

179
00:24:57,921 --> 00:25:02,121
<i>to hide slow and deliberate
tail movements,</i>

180
00:25:02,201 --> 00:25:04,001
<i>it edges ever closer.</i>

181
00:25:08,641 --> 00:25:11,121
<i>It must get to within a few centimetres,</i>

182
00:25:11,201 --> 00:25:13,601
<i>close enough for a sudden strike.</i>

183
00:25:26,161 --> 00:25:27,401
<i>Got one.</i>

184
00:25:38,761 --> 00:25:42,401
<i>The deep-water currents
that sustain so many residents</i>

185
00:25:42,481 --> 00:25:45,521
<i>also attract visitors to these oases.</i>

186
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:52,521
<i>Silky sharks.</i>

187
00:25:57,321 --> 00:26:00,561
<i>They journey hundreds of miles
between sea mounts,</i>

188
00:26:00,641 --> 00:26:04,161
<i>using them as gathering places
in the featureless ocean.</i>

189
00:26:10,721 --> 00:26:13,001
<i>They’re joined by hammerheads.</i>

190
00:26:17,841 --> 00:26:21,601
<i>Both these sharks constantly
travel between the Galápagos</i>

191
00:26:21,681 --> 00:26:25,241
<i>and other isolated sea mounts
in the Eastern Pacific.</i>

192
00:26:31,161 --> 00:26:34,601
<i>No one knows for sure why they
gather in such numbers,</i>

193
00:26:35,361 --> 00:26:38,961
<i>but some certainly come
to these oases in search of food.</i>

194
00:26:47,001 --> 00:26:51,441
<i>A school of resident silver sides
cloaks the sea mount.</i>

195
00:26:53,161 --> 00:26:55,721
<i>If these little fish
stay close to the coral</i>

196
00:26:55,801 --> 00:26:58,201
<i>the sharks won't be able to get at them.</i>

197
00:27:18,081 --> 00:27:22,841
<i>Other more agile visitors are attracted
by the potential feast.</i>

198
00:27:25,481 --> 00:27:27,081
<i>Striped bonito.</i>

199
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:30,881
<i>And golden trevally.</i>

200
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:41,441
<i>To get a meal they'll need to drive
their prey up and away from the reef</i>

201
00:27:41,521 --> 00:27:43,121
<i>into open water.</i>

202
00:27:45,921 --> 00:27:49,521
<i>As long as the silver sides
stick close to the sea floor</i>

203
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:51,801
<i>they should evade their predators.</i>

204
00:28:13,481 --> 00:28:17,721
<i>This time the frustrated hunters
will have to search elsewhere.</i>

205
00:28:17,801 --> 00:28:21,361
<i>There's never an easy meal
in the open ocean.</i>

206
00:28:34,561 --> 00:28:37,881
<i>The Southern Ocean,
encircling Antarctica...</i>

207
00:28:43,001 --> 00:28:45,321
<i>The wildest seas on our planet.</i>

208
00:28:48,041 --> 00:28:53,001
<i>Here, it's these storm-tossed waters
that bring nutrients to the surface,</i>

209
00:28:53,081 --> 00:28:55,721
<i>creating isolated patches of richness.</i>

210
00:28:58,681 --> 00:29:00,561
<i>Far from the calm tropics,</i>

211
00:29:00,641 --> 00:29:04,601
<i>this weather-beaten ocean
is home to the albatross.</i>

212
00:29:13,201 --> 00:29:15,001
<i>Black browed albatross</i>

213
00:29:15,081 --> 00:29:17,441
<i>are the same size as frigate birds,</i>

214
00:29:17,521 --> 00:29:19,401
<i>but three times as heavy,</i>

215
00:29:19,481 --> 00:29:22,921
<i>and so they need
a totally different flying technique.</i>

216
00:29:27,561 --> 00:29:32,041
<i>Albatross have the longest wingspan
of any bird</i>

217
00:29:32,121 --> 00:29:36,801
<i>and that enables them to exploit
the power of the Southern Ocean winds.</i>

218
00:29:40,841 --> 00:29:43,361
<i>First, they glide into the wind,</i>

219
00:29:43,441 --> 00:29:46,201
<i>harnessing its energy to give them lift.</i>

220
00:29:49,201 --> 00:29:53,361
<i>Then they turn and descend downwind,
picking up speed.</i>

221
00:30:00,641 --> 00:30:03,761
<i>Soaring on wind fronts like this</i>

222
00:30:03,841 --> 00:30:08,321
<i>an albatross can travel
hundreds of miles of ocean in a day,</i>

223
00:30:10,001 --> 00:30:12,201
<i>barely beating its wings.</i>

224
00:30:17,641 --> 00:30:20,361
<i>They often spend weeks at sea</i>

225
00:30:20,441 --> 00:30:24,521
<i>searching for prey
without ever returning to land.</i>

226
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:38,721
<i>Food at last...</i>

227
00:30:38,801 --> 00:30:41,441
<i>A patch of krill close to the surface.</i>

228
00:30:44,321 --> 00:30:46,801
<i>Because the winds are so strong here</i>

229
00:30:46,881 --> 00:30:50,601
<i>albatrosses can afford
the extra weight of waterproofing oils</i>

230
00:30:50,681 --> 00:30:52,281
<i>on their feathers.</i>

231
00:30:54,201 --> 00:30:56,641
<i>They can duck dive
to no more than a meter</i>

232
00:30:56,721 --> 00:31:00,001
<i>so they rely on the churning
of the Southern Ocean</i>

233
00:31:00,081 --> 00:31:02,681
<i>to bring their prey up into range.</i>

234
00:31:32,241 --> 00:31:35,881
<i>Like all birds,
albatross have to breed on land,</i>

235
00:31:35,961 --> 00:31:39,161
<i>but suitable islands
are so few in the South Atlantic</i>

236
00:31:39,241 --> 00:31:41,641
<i>that most are heavily overcrowded.</i>

237
00:31:46,601 --> 00:31:51,321
<i>Steeple Jason, one of the largest
albatross colonies in the world.</i>

238
00:31:59,121 --> 00:32:03,321
<i>Nearly half a million come back here
each year to raise their young.</i>

239
00:32:12,241 --> 00:32:14,881
<i>Adults share parenting duties,</i>

240
00:32:14,961 --> 00:32:17,921
<i>returning every few days
to feed their chick.</i>

241
00:32:27,001 --> 00:32:28,761
<i>Feeding done,</i>

242
00:32:29,561 --> 00:32:32,081
<i>it's time to head out to sea.</i>

243
00:32:38,321 --> 00:32:41,441
<i>They need to make their way
to the edge of the packed colony</i>

244
00:32:41,521 --> 00:32:43,601
<i>where there's more room for take-off.</i>

245
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:48,441
<i>Albatrosses are so heavy</i>

246
00:32:48,521 --> 00:32:52,881
<i>that they can only get airborne in
places where the wind is strong enough.</i>

247
00:32:56,121 --> 00:32:58,161
<i>Using a special runway,</i>

248
00:33:00,921 --> 00:33:02,881
<i>with a good head wind...</i>

249
00:33:09,121 --> 00:33:10,441
<i>She's off.</i>

250
00:33:20,521 --> 00:33:24,081
<i>From the air
the ocean may appear featureless,</i>

251
00:33:25,361 --> 00:33:29,001
<i>but beneath the surface
a network of powerful currents</i>

252
00:33:29,081 --> 00:33:31,121
<i>is constantly on the move.</i>

253
00:33:33,881 --> 00:33:37,081
<i>It's these currents,
more than any other force,</i>

254
00:33:37,161 --> 00:33:40,361
<i>that determine the distribution
of life out here.</i>

255
00:33:43,241 --> 00:33:45,761
<i>A whole community of ocean drifters</i>

256
00:33:45,841 --> 00:33:48,601
<i>hitches rides
on these rivers in the sea.</i>

257
00:33:51,521 --> 00:33:53,481
<i>Pelagic red crabs.</i>

258
00:34:04,241 --> 00:34:07,761
<i>They've gathered to feed on
tiny floating plants and animals,</i>

259
00:34:07,841 --> 00:34:11,121
<i>a bloom of plankton
fueled by the currents.</i>

260
00:34:21,681 --> 00:34:25,321
<i>Fine hairs on their legs
slow their descent,</i>

261
00:34:27,601 --> 00:34:32,081
<i>and then with a few flicks of the tail
they swim back up</i>

262
00:34:32,161 --> 00:34:33,881
<i>to continue feeding.</i>

263
00:34:43,641 --> 00:34:46,521
<i>The currents that carry
these wandering crabs</i>

264
00:34:46,601 --> 00:34:50,921
<i>also serve as highways
for the ocean's larger predators.</i>

265
00:34:55,841 --> 00:34:57,761
<i>Striped marlin.</i>

266
00:35:02,761 --> 00:35:04,161
<i>Beautifully streamlined,</i>

267
00:35:04,241 --> 00:35:08,041
<i>they can travel huge distances
with minimum effort.</i>

268
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:13,721
<i>These hunters patrol the boundaries
between ocean currents,</i>

269
00:35:13,801 --> 00:35:16,081
<i>where their prey often gathers.</i>

270
00:35:19,161 --> 00:35:22,321
<i>Each predator
has an incredible sense of smell,</i>

271
00:35:22,401 --> 00:35:25,721
<i>able to detect faint trails
left by their prey.</i>

272
00:35:30,841 --> 00:35:34,241
<i>Somewhere out here is the big prize...</i>

273
00:35:36,121 --> 00:35:38,521
<i>And hunters of all kinds
are looking for it.</i>

274
00:35:56,041 --> 00:36:00,721
<i>Great shoals of fish
are attracted to a plankton bloom.</i>

275
00:36:02,001 --> 00:36:05,521
<i>A single school of sardines
can be many miles long.</i>

276
00:36:11,121 --> 00:36:13,401
<i>The fish swim tightly together.</i>

277
00:36:14,441 --> 00:36:16,481
<i>There's safety in numbers.</i>

278
00:36:20,641 --> 00:36:23,681
<i>Their defense relies on coordination.</i>

279
00:36:28,081 --> 00:36:31,521
<i>When attacked, the sardines move as one.</i>

280
00:36:40,641 --> 00:36:44,281
<i>Each fish instantly matches
the movements of its neighbour</i>

281
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:48,801
<i>and the whole shoal moves in synchrony.</i>

282
00:36:56,161 --> 00:37:00,321
<i>A lone sea lion can't keep up
with their rapid reactions.</i>

283
00:37:09,681 --> 00:37:12,281
<i>Even when more sea lions arrive</i>

284
00:37:12,361 --> 00:37:16,961
<i>they can't seem to break down
the sardines' coordinated defenses.</i>

285
00:37:34,721 --> 00:37:36,441
<i>The shoal this big,</i>

286
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:40,801
<i>the sea lions need to isolate
a smaller more manageable group of fish.</i>

287
00:37:46,361 --> 00:37:48,241
<i>But with so few predators</i>

288
00:37:48,321 --> 00:37:50,761
<i>the fish still have the advantage.</i>

289
00:37:56,121 --> 00:38:00,441
<i>All the sea lions can do
is keep the sardines at the surface</i>

290
00:38:00,521 --> 00:38:02,921
<i>and wait for others to join them.</i>

291
00:38:12,281 --> 00:38:13,441
<i>Tuna.</i>

292
00:38:14,601 --> 00:38:17,401
<i>Their arrival changes everything.</i>

293
00:38:30,161 --> 00:38:34,041
<i>Tuna attack from below
cutting off the sardines' escape route</i>

294
00:38:34,121 --> 00:38:35,921
<i>down to deeper water.</i>

295
00:38:44,601 --> 00:38:48,001
<i>Next to appear, shear waters,</i>

296
00:38:48,081 --> 00:38:52,321
<i>excellent flyers,
but also surprisingly agile underwater.</i>

297
00:38:56,081 --> 00:38:59,321
<i>With so many predators
attacking from all sides,</i>

298
00:38:59,401 --> 00:39:03,641
<i>the advantage starts to shift away
from the sardines.</i>

299
00:39:23,521 --> 00:39:25,681
<i>As the fish pack ever tighter</i>

300
00:39:25,761 --> 00:39:29,521
<i>their shoaling strategy
now makes it easier for the hunters.</i>

301
00:39:54,361 --> 00:39:56,161
<i>Copper sharks...</i>

302
00:39:56,241 --> 00:39:59,081
<i>They've scented blood in the water.</i>

303
00:40:05,201 --> 00:40:09,441
<i>Surprisingly, perhaps, the predators
never attack one another,</i>

304
00:40:09,521 --> 00:40:12,721
<i>they work together to corral
the ball of fish,</i>

305
00:40:12,801 --> 00:40:15,121
<i>taking turns to grab a mouthful.</i>

306
00:40:24,481 --> 00:40:26,081
<i>Common dolphins.</i>

307
00:40:29,681 --> 00:40:31,561
<i>As the shoal gets ever smaller</i>

308
00:40:31,641 --> 00:40:35,761
<i>each sardine scrambles desperately
to hide in the middle,</i>

309
00:40:36,401 --> 00:40:38,481
<i>but now there's no escape.</i>

310
00:40:57,481 --> 00:41:01,241
<i>A Bryde's whale
finishes off the feast...</i>

311
00:41:02,281 --> 00:41:06,361
<i>Tonnes of sardines
devoured in less than an hour.</i>

312
00:41:18,001 --> 00:41:21,161
<i>The predators melt away into the blue,</i>

313
00:41:23,961 --> 00:41:26,921
<i>going their separate ways once more.</i>

314
00:41:37,321 --> 00:41:40,641
<i>This blue whale
is still searching for a meal</i>

315
00:41:40,721 --> 00:41:42,881
<i>to satisfy its giant hunger.</i>

316
00:41:45,881 --> 00:41:51,601
<i>Being so large it must catch
an average of four tonnes of food a day.</i>

317
00:41:56,641 --> 00:42:00,601
<i>But many days may pass
without feeding at all.</i>

318
00:42:05,721 --> 00:42:07,681
<i>It is their great size</i>

319
00:42:07,761 --> 00:42:11,281
<i>that enables blue whales to travel
the furthest,</i>

320
00:42:12,721 --> 00:42:16,321
<i>roaming every ocean
from the tropics to the poles.</i>

321
00:42:30,081 --> 00:42:33,281
<i>Trapped against the surface by fish</i>

322
00:42:33,361 --> 00:42:35,681
<i>a dense patch of krill.</i>

323
00:42:40,401 --> 00:42:45,201
<i>This blue has finally found what it's
been searching for, for so long.</i>

324
00:42:47,401 --> 00:42:52,521
<i>A meal big enough to make opening
its massive mouth worthwhile.</i>

325
00:42:56,961 --> 00:43:00,361
<i>The krill swarm
is hundreds of metres across</i>

326
00:43:01,241 --> 00:43:02,881
<i>and packed tight.</i>

327
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:13,401
<i>The whale lines up on its prey,</i>

328
00:43:13,481 --> 00:43:16,241
<i>targeting the densest part of the shoal.</i>

329
00:43:56,041 --> 00:44:00,401
<i>It takes so much effort to swim
with a fully extended throat</i>

330
00:44:01,361 --> 00:44:04,681
<i>that the whale
virtually comes to a standstill.</i>

331
00:44:17,441 --> 00:44:22,281
<i>The whale uses its tongue
to force the water out of its mouth,</i>

332
00:44:22,361 --> 00:44:27,201
<i>trapping the krill on plates
of hairy bristles that line its jaw.</i>

333
00:44:31,241 --> 00:44:34,521
<i>But it takes time to sieve
so much water.</i>

334
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:40,281
<i>And that gives more nimble hunters
their chance.</i>

335
00:44:55,241 --> 00:44:59,121
<i>Blue whales may not be
as agile as other hunters,</i>

336
00:44:59,201 --> 00:45:01,241
<i>but they don't need to be.</i>

337
00:45:03,641 --> 00:45:05,641
<i>In one giant mouthful</i>

338
00:45:05,721 --> 00:45:09,161
<i>they can swallow whole swarms of krill.</i>

339
00:45:59,961 --> 00:46:03,001
<i>No other predator is better suited</i>

340
00:46:03,081 --> 00:46:05,681
<i>to exploit these scattered riches</i>

341
00:46:05,761 --> 00:46:08,121
<i>that the open ocean can provide.</i>

342
00:46:12,481 --> 00:46:14,001
<i>The blue whale,</i>

343
00:46:15,441 --> 00:46:19,481
<i>the greatest hunter
in all the world's oceans.</i>

344
00:46:56,601 --> 00:47:00,641
<i>The open ocean created</i>
<i>many challenges for</i> The Hunt <i>team.</i>

345
00:47:02,721 --> 00:47:07,121
<i>But none came bigger than trying to film
blue whales underwater.</i>

346
00:47:08,681 --> 00:47:12,361
<i>Achieving this was to turn
into a two-year mission.</i>

347
00:47:14,681 --> 00:47:17,401
<i>The crew teamed up
with John Calambokidis,</i>

348
00:47:17,481 --> 00:47:20,081
<i>the world's foremost
blue whale scientist.</i>

349
00:47:22,081 --> 00:47:26,201
<i>John gets crucial information
from these harmless tags.</i>

350
00:47:28,641 --> 00:47:31,281
<i>But he can only observe blue whales</i>

351
00:47:31,361 --> 00:47:33,681
<i>for the brief time they surface.</i>

352
00:47:35,881 --> 00:47:39,001
Well, part of this research
and part of the reason that, uh,

353
00:47:39,081 --> 00:47:43,321
we're working with filmmakers is that
it gives us a unique chance to get,

354
00:47:43,401 --> 00:47:46,121
uh, scientific information
we wouldn't be able to otherwise.

355
00:47:46,201 --> 00:47:50,001
So we are doing this under our
research permit to get an insight

356
00:47:50,081 --> 00:47:52,321
into what they're doing underwater,
how they're diving,

357
00:47:52,401 --> 00:47:54,161
how they're swimming,
how they're feeding.

358
00:47:57,081 --> 00:47:59,921
Pictures of blue whales are rare,

359
00:48:00,001 --> 00:48:02,121
they're the biggest animal
ever to live on the planet,

360
00:48:02,161 --> 00:48:06,041
but there are only a few
underwater pictures that exist today.

361
00:48:06,121 --> 00:48:08,001
A few where you can actually
see the animal.

362
00:48:08,721 --> 00:48:12,001
<i>First, they have to find a blue whale.</i>

363
00:48:12,081 --> 00:48:15,161
Well, I always feel really embarrassed,
you know, because how can you lose

364
00:48:15,241 --> 00:48:17,601
the biggest animal
that's ever lived,

365
00:48:17,681 --> 00:48:21,121
but, uh, while the whale is big,
the ocean is even bigger.

366
00:48:26,001 --> 00:48:27,601
Just over there.

367
00:48:28,961 --> 00:48:33,081
<i>The team's success
will depend on good water visibility.</i>

368
00:48:35,401 --> 00:48:40,041
<i>Too murky and the whale
literally disappears into the gloom.</i>

369
00:48:44,641 --> 00:48:45,841
No shot.

370
00:48:47,681 --> 00:48:50,481
<i>The first year
was blighted by poor visibility</i>

371
00:48:50,561 --> 00:48:52,841
<i>and the shoot ended in failure.</i>

372
00:48:57,521 --> 00:48:59,161
<i>Year two</i>

373
00:48:59,241 --> 00:49:01,961
<i>and the sea conditions are much better.</i>

374
00:49:05,161 --> 00:49:06,921
Oh, here he is, right there.

375
00:49:07,001 --> 00:49:10,521
<i>Blue whales only surface
for two to three minutes at a time</i>

376
00:49:10,601 --> 00:49:13,801
<i>before diving for up to 15 minutes.</i>

377
00:49:13,881 --> 00:49:17,641
<i>It's a narrow window
for everything to come together.</i>

378
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:19,481
There's a bit of tricky
maneuvering here for John.

379
00:49:19,561 --> 00:49:22,041
And he's got to try and get the boat

380
00:49:22,121 --> 00:49:24,401
ahead of the whale,
but not in front of it.

381
00:49:28,361 --> 00:49:29,961
<i>Then, David has to swim out</i>

382
00:49:30,001 --> 00:49:33,361
<i>and hope the whale passes
close enough to get a shot.</i>

383
00:49:40,201 --> 00:49:41,681
It's too far.

384
00:49:42,921 --> 00:49:44,881
It's a little too far that time.

385
00:49:53,481 --> 00:49:56,241
<i>This year the water
is exceptionally clear,</i>

386
00:49:58,961 --> 00:50:02,521
<i>but getting David in the right position
still takes time.</i>

387
00:50:04,681 --> 00:50:07,841
He went by, I definitely got a shot,
it's not one of our best.

388
00:50:18,161 --> 00:50:19,201
Missed it.

389
00:50:22,281 --> 00:50:23,561
<i>After weeks of effort</i>

390
00:50:23,641 --> 00:50:26,041
<i>all the elements finally come together</i>

391
00:50:26,121 --> 00:50:28,761
<i>giving David the chance of a lifetime.</i>

392
00:50:31,641 --> 00:50:34,921
<i>Once I got down about 25 feet
I knew that whale was out there.</i>

393
00:50:35,001 --> 00:50:39,481
<i>But, uh, he just came out of the blue,
right to me.</i>

394
00:50:45,481 --> 00:50:48,841
<i>I could see his eye,
the details of his mouth,</i>

395
00:50:48,921 --> 00:50:51,001
<i>every scratch on his skin,</i>

396
00:50:52,281 --> 00:50:54,961
<i>and he cruised on by, it took forever.</i>

397
00:50:55,041 --> 00:50:58,441
<i>You know, they're so big
it just went by like a freight train.</i>

398
00:51:02,761 --> 00:51:04,681
<i>I saw his tail slide by.</i>

399
00:51:05,161 --> 00:51:07,121
<i>It slipped back into the blue.</i>

400
00:51:08,001 --> 00:51:09,721
It was awesome.

401
00:51:10,441 --> 00:51:13,401
That is awesome, I have never...
Of all my years of doing this,

402
00:51:13,481 --> 00:51:14,921
I've never got a shot like that.

403
00:51:15,161 --> 00:51:16,441
<i>That was amazing.</i>

404
00:51:17,321 --> 00:51:20,561
<i>Images of blue whales
underwater are so rare</i>

405
00:51:20,641 --> 00:51:25,601
<i>that this shot, one simply swimming by
is a major success.</i>

406
00:51:26,241 --> 00:51:28,321
<i>But the crew need more.</i>

407
00:51:29,481 --> 00:51:31,081
This series is all about hunting,

408
00:51:31,161 --> 00:51:34,881
and so nice though it is to have
that shot to make a sequence

409
00:51:34,961 --> 00:51:38,241
we've got to get shots
of blue whales eating krill.

410
00:51:38,841 --> 00:51:40,161
And what we've got to wait for

411
00:51:40,241 --> 00:51:42,441
is when the krill
actually comes to the surface.

412
00:51:42,521 --> 00:51:45,001
<i>It might happen once,
maybe twice a month.</i>

413
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:50,281
<i>The crew come across
an encouraging sign</i>

414
00:51:50,361 --> 00:51:53,041
<i>from a rather unsavory source.</i>

415
00:51:53,121 --> 00:51:55,801
That's a whale faeces.

416
00:51:57,561 --> 00:52:00,881
So we've found a big
whale poo in the water,

417
00:52:00,961 --> 00:52:04,081
um, it's a good sign for us,
we know that they're feeding here,

418
00:52:04,161 --> 00:52:05,641
so maybe they'll stick around.

419
00:52:07,761 --> 00:52:11,001
<i>Finally the crew find
what they've been looking for.</i>

420
00:52:11,081 --> 00:52:13,161
<i>Krill at the surface.</i>

421
00:52:13,241 --> 00:52:14,881
Look at those birds in the water.

422
00:52:14,921 --> 00:52:16,601
So, there's a small krill ball.

423
00:52:17,081 --> 00:52:19,081
We're going to go take a look at it.

424
00:52:19,161 --> 00:52:21,321
All right, John, remember,
don't put me right on top of it.

425
00:52:21,401 --> 00:52:22,441
All right, ready?

426
00:52:22,521 --> 00:52:23,561
Okay, the ball's right here.

427
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:25,481
- Right here, right here.
- Is it on the surface?

428
00:52:25,561 --> 00:52:27,561
- Yep. Right at the top.
- Good red?

429
00:52:28,401 --> 00:52:29,641
Yeah, got it.

430
00:52:32,921 --> 00:52:36,241
<i>No one was prepared
for what happened next.</i>

431
00:52:37,841 --> 00:52:40,641
It's right behind you.
Hey, Hugh, here it comes!

432
00:52:41,641 --> 00:52:42,681
Oh!

433
00:52:44,801 --> 00:52:46,201
Massive surface.

434
00:52:47,081 --> 00:52:50,521
Oh, God!
That's a shot I bet you got it.

435
00:52:51,681 --> 00:52:52,921
I bet you got it.

436
00:52:53,001 --> 00:52:54,121
Ooh!

437
00:52:58,081 --> 00:52:59,721
God, they're beautiful,
aren't they?

438
00:53:01,401 --> 00:53:02,481
What you guys get?
What you guys get?

439
00:53:02,561 --> 00:53:04,161
Oh, my God.

440
00:53:05,961 --> 00:53:07,201
Oh, my God.

441
00:53:08,881 --> 00:53:12,561
I still, I can't actually quite get
my head around what I just saw.

442
00:53:12,641 --> 00:53:15,641
We were down there,
Dave was filming the krill balls

443
00:53:15,721 --> 00:53:19,001
and I just noticed, literally,
between his fins

444
00:53:19,081 --> 00:53:22,121
this massive
great whale just loomed out.

445
00:53:23,081 --> 00:53:25,121
<i>David saw it climb down,</i>

446
00:53:25,921 --> 00:53:27,241
<i>I don't know where it came from.</i>

447
00:53:30,321 --> 00:53:32,201
Well, when I first looked down
I saw this whale,

448
00:53:32,281 --> 00:53:34,241
of course, I was a little bit
stressed out because

449
00:53:34,281 --> 00:53:38,361
95 feet of blue whale
is going between my fins.

450
00:53:38,761 --> 00:53:43,081
He hooks around, comes up
and just grabs a big mouthful.

451
00:53:49,201 --> 00:53:51,201
They're called blue whales
for a reason,

452
00:53:51,281 --> 00:53:52,641
but you just see them underwater,

453
00:53:52,721 --> 00:53:57,561
this bright iridescent cobalt blue just
pops out of the blue of the ocean.

454
00:54:00,881 --> 00:54:02,641
<i>And then finally I get round
to the other side</i>

455
00:54:02,721 --> 00:54:04,361
<i>and I go, "Okay, he left, " and then,
"Phew!"you know,</i>

456
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:05,481
<i>that is pretty intense.</i>

457
00:54:05,801 --> 00:54:07,241
So I'm up
trying to just get another shot

458
00:54:07,321 --> 00:54:08,641
of the krill and sure enough,

459
00:54:08,721 --> 00:54:10,441
wide open he comes to one last time.

460
00:54:10,521 --> 00:54:11,881
I was, kind of, in the wrong spot,

461
00:54:11,921 --> 00:54:14,441
I had to do some serious,
basic maneuvers

462
00:54:14,521 --> 00:54:15,841
but he comes through, closes his mouth,

463
00:54:15,921 --> 00:54:18,081
it was just amazing.

464
00:54:24,321 --> 00:54:26,521
The whole thing probably
lasted 10 minutes,

465
00:54:26,601 --> 00:54:29,201
but it was hands down, without a doubt,

466
00:54:29,281 --> 00:54:32,761
no questions, was the most intense,
amazing thing that I've ever seen.

467
00:54:42,721 --> 00:54:46,041
To share the water and to look
eye to eye with a blue whale

468
00:54:46,121 --> 00:54:48,161
is something I will never ever forget.

469
00:54:51,361 --> 00:54:53,881
<i>These shots
give John a unique insight</i>

470
00:54:53,961 --> 00:54:56,401
<i>into the feeding behaviour
of blue whales.</i>

471
00:54:56,481 --> 00:54:59,881
Let's just look at the
side of his mouth there, uh, basically

472
00:54:59,961 --> 00:55:03,241
the water flow you'd expect
to be coming out the back there.

473
00:55:03,921 --> 00:55:07,041
Yeah, look at that little fold
there, that is really interesting.

474
00:55:08,081 --> 00:55:09,121
Ah...

475
00:55:11,201 --> 00:55:13,161
Oh, that's a great view.

476
00:55:14,121 --> 00:55:17,681
That's fantastic.
And notice the full rotation there.

477
00:55:17,761 --> 00:55:20,721
Oh, that is... And the full inversion.

478
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:25,681
Okay, that's again a unique chance to
see a perspective we don't get to see.

1
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,526
I actually don't see myself
as being special',

2
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,526
<i>because I'm not.</i>

3
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,801
<i>Not really.</i>

4
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,668
Uh, these are green peppers.

5
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:04,933
Uh, sage.

6
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:08,912
<i>So I try not to think about it
and I just go about living my life.</i>

7
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:12,916
Look at this one. See that? It's a nice one.

8
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:18,379
<i>It's not something I'm ashamed of
or anything like that.</i>

9
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:22,254
<i>- But it's not something I'm proud of, either.</i>

10
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:27,589
<i>Because I had nothing to do with it.</i>

11
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:31,928
You don't get to choose when you're born.

12
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:36,406
<i>And as you can see here, the waxing gibbous
will be taking us toward the weekend.</i>

13
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:41,037
<i>And then on Saturday, we'll have a full moon,
and that's a perigee for this orbit.</i>

14
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,240
<i>So just keep that in mind
as you're planning your weekend.</i>

15
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:46,512
<i>Family dinners may be
a little more quarrelsome than usual,</i>

16
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:50,214
<i>especially if you've got some menstruating
teenagers around the table.</i>

17
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:54,156
<i>Andrew's been working for us
for almost three years now.</i>

18
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,563
<i>And I've really come to value him.</i>

19
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,622
- Hi, Andrew. Good morning.
-Good morning. Heading out?

20
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:05,829
<i>Because he's good at his job.
It's that simple.</i>

21
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:07,735
The lamp in my bedroom needs a bulb.

22
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,569
<i>- And the fact is...</i>
- Okay, yeah, I <i>can replace it.</i>

23
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,906
...a lot of people we know can't find men
to do the job anymore.

24
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:19,016
So they're having to hire women,
which is obviously a lot more expensive.

25
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:26,348
- Good morning.
- Good morning!

26
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:29,325
<i>Maybe it's because he is
so much younger than the other men</i>

27
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:31,384
<i>we've had working for us,</i>

28
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:36,830
<i>but I do worry about the impact
his presence has on our kids.</i>

29
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:39,900
Really, you got a fever?

30
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:44,165
It's not that I'm worried that he's
corrupting them or anything like that.

31
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:48,178
It's more that having a man like him around

32
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:52,740
might make them yearn for something
they can't have... Shouldn't have.

33
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,078
I like the kids being exposed
to a man like Andrew.

34
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:02,520
Someone who's more in his prime,
more vital and active.

35
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:04,186
I think you're gonna be late for school

36
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,025
and you should go get ready.
What are you doing?

37
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:09,623
I <i>mean,</i> I <i>know it's not</i>
a <i>very popular thing to say,</i>

38
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,600
<i>but I think it's enriching their lives.</i>

39
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:12,728
Nine minutes.

40
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:14,362
All our lives.

41
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,368
Yeah, I suppose
from a historical point of view,

42
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:22,811
there's some truth to that.

43
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:26,239
<i>Seventy-five years from now,</i>

44
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:30,686
<i>our daughters will be able to give
their daughters and granddaughters</i>

45
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:34,255
<i>a firsthand account
of what men were really like.</i>

46
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:37,091
Yeah, I think that's important.

47
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:42,260
It's nature's way.

48
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:44,359
Praise nature.

49
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:47,835
<i>My name is Andrew Myers.</i>

50
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:52,641
lam 37 years old,
and I'm the youngest man in the world.

51
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:16,130
<i>In 1953 I was a young priest,
just out of the seminary.</i>

52
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:19,894
<i>I was blessed with the good fortune
of being assigned to the Vatican</i>

53
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:24,567
<i>to work for an order known as
the Congregation of the Causes for Saints.</i>

54
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:30,180
<i>It was our responsibility
to investigate events</i>

55
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:34,651
<i>that were so extraordinary
that they could be deemed a divine miracle.</i>

56
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,877
<i>Every year, there were many claims made.</i>

57
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,925
<i>Stigmatas, apparitions of the Virgin Mary,</i>

58
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,325
<i>the healing of deadly medical conditions</i>

59
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:46,864
<i>and, of course, virgin births.</i>

60
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:54,163
<i>In a typical year, there would be</i>

61
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:59,370
<i>no more than three or four reports
of virgin births that warranted any attention.</i>

62
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:07,511
<i>But in 1953, there were 67 virgin birth claims.</i>

63
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,488
You have to remember
<i>that</i> fatherless pregnancies

64
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,053
<i>first began more than half a century ago.</i>

65
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:24,397
This is back when Abrahamic
religions dominated the world,

66
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:28,769
and Christianity, which had nearly
two billion worshippers at that time,

67
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:32,901
regarded virgin birth
as one of its most sacred tenets.

68
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:38,874
<i>Christians believe that a virgin named Mary</i>

69
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:42,511
<i>gave birth to their Holy Prophet,
Jesus Christ,</i>

70
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:45,579
<i>and that he was fathered by their God.</i>

71
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:50,094
So you can see why
the Church was so concerned

72
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:53,392
about the sudden profusion
of virgin birth claims.

73
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:58,163
Because if they were true,
and the Vatican could not prove otherwise,

74
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,837
then they would have to be
considered miracles.

75
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:06,570
Except miracles, by their very nature,
are extremely rare events.

76
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:11,471
<i>of course, it wasn't just
women who were virgins</i>

77
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,642
<i>that were making these claims.</i>

78
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,777
<i>All sorts of women were coming forward.</i>

79
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:21,516
But there was no way to
scientifically validate the claims.

80
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:24,187
There was no DNA testing back then,

81
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,094
and the blood testing that we did have
could only prove

82
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:31,863
that a particular man wasn't the father,
not that there was no father at all.

83
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:39,637
<i>You see, like all mammals,
humans could not procreate</i>

84
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:42,805
<i>without intercourse
between a male and a female.</i>

85
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:45,315
<i>It was scientifically impossible.</i>

86
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:50,955
So despite the growing number of women
making fatherless pregnancy claims,

87
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:54,957
the only logical conclusion was
that they were all lying.

88
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:01,393
<i>My doctor was the one who told me.</i>

89
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,735
<i>That's how you found out back then.</i>

90
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:10,673
This was 1953, and I might have
been young, but I wasn't stupid.

91
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,870
I knew the signs. I felt awful.

92
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:19,305
The problem was, there was no possible way
that I could be pregnant.

93
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,081
<i>Richard, he was my husband,</i>

94
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:28,888
<i>he insisted that I get retested
because he knew the same thing I did.</i>

95
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,661
<i>We hadn't been intimate for over a year.</i>

96
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:39,292
<i>As soon as the doctor walked in,
I knew what he was going to say.</i>

97
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:43,440
<i>That there was no mistake with the test.</i>

98
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:46,739
There was no mistake with the test.
Your wife is pregnant.

99
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,780
<i>Richard demanded
to know who I'd been with.</i>

100
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:52,009
Who were you with? What's his name?

101
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:53,846
<i>I swore to him
that! hadn't been unfaithful.</i>

102
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:55,078
I haven't been with anyone.

103
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,279
<i>But he didn't believe me.</i>

104
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:58,322
Of course, you have. You're pregnant.

105
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:02,484
<i>I tried to explain to the doctor
that this was impossible.</i>

106
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:04,960
<i>He just looked at me like I was a child.</i>

107
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:09,261
Do you understand how procreation works,
how babies are made?

108
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,632
You see, when a man and a woman
have sexual relations...

109
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:17,903
It wasn't until 1988 that they had these tests
that could show that I was telling the truth,

110
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:21,710
not that it mattered by that point.
It was obvious.

111
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:23,178
But back then,

112
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:27,942
nobody believed me.

113
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:36,725
<i>The harder I tried to convince people
I was telling the truth,</i>

114
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:38,921
the crazier <i>I</i> seemed.

115
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:41,989
<i>And pretty soon,
I began to wonder if I was crazy.</i>

116
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:46,530
How else could you explain
something like that?

117
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:50,096
<i>It's outlandish. Not even worth discussing.</i>

118
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:53,336
<i>But, Senator, you must admit
these statistics are compelling.</i>

119
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,379
<i>United States, 10,000 claims.</i>

120
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:57,414
<i>Great Britain, 6,000 claims.</i>

121
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,246
<i>India, 20,000 claims.</i>

122
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:02,582
<i>Even Soviet women are claiming
to have become pregnant.</i>

123
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:04,815
<i>We all know that women, by nature,</i>

124
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,949
<i>are very impressionable
and prone to hysterics.</i>

125
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:10,119
<i>It's a known fact.</i>

126
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:13,322
<i>Now perhaps the hormonal changes
involved in pregnancy</i>

127
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,992
<i>amplify this hysteria
and their own gullibility.</i>

128
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:21,533
<i>And then, you see, they hear
about another woman's bizarre claim</i>

129
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:24,165
<i>about her pregnancy,
and suddenly they're all doing it.</i>

130
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,609
<i>They cannot help themselves.
It becomes a fad.</i>

131
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:33,314
Here we have the major developed countries
that existed at that time.

132
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:36,581
<i>What's interesting is that
governments all over the world,</i>

133
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:39,316
with every different kind
of political structure,

134
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:41,824
remember this was before unification,

135
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:44,725
when faced with fatherless
pregnancy claims,

136
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:47,492
they all reacted the exact same way.

137
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:50,261
<i>I've been very preoccupied
with other matters for a while.</i>

138
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,132
<i>I'd have to ask a little more time.</i>

139
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:53,795
<i>Sir, will you
be able to have an opinion</i>

140
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:55,532
<i>-a little later on?
-I'm not sure.</i>

141
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:59,600
<i>It has certainly been a surprising spectacle.</i>

142
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:03,005
<i>They pretended like
it wasn't happening.</i>

143
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:08,209
<i>But this is not so hard to fathom
when you consider that</i>

144
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:12,188
<i>at that time, every one
of those governments was run by men.</i>

145
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:19,427
<i>Personally, I can understand
the position the authorities took.</i>

146
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:21,863
It would have been irresponsible
just to come out and say

147
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:25,835
that a growing number of women
were procreating without male insemination.

148
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:29,333
On the whole, men are rational beings.

149
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,876
But we have egos, too.

150
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:36,905
And nobody likes being told
they're becoming obsolete.

151
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:54,395
<i>Obviously, it's not for everyone,</i>

152
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:57,662
<i>but I still look forward
to going to work every morning.</i>

153
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,932
<i>There's not a lot of guys who can say that.</i>

154
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:05,732
Not anymore.

155
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:09,007
Come on, I'm gonna tell Mommy.

156
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:10,741
Come on, you.

157
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:13,113
<i>There's lots of things
I <i>like about him.</i>

158
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:18,349
<i>He's fun to be around.
And he's caring, he's easy to talk to.</i>

159
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:21,290
- Andrew, I can't see.
- Okay, let's take a break.

160
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:27,161
If we still had fathers,
he'd definitely be the kind I'd want for Violet.

161
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:32,534
<i>What's that word they used to say
about a man who looked appealing?</i>

162
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:35,094
<i>Handser? Hands...</i>

163
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:37,664
- Handsome?
- Handsome. Yeah.

164
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,108
Well, that's what they would
have said about Andrew.

165
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,474
That he's handsome.

166
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,445
Parasitism, competition

167
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:45,982
-and mutualism.
-Right there?

168
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:49,850
<i>This is actually
the third household that I've worked in.</i>

169
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:52,213
<i>And they've all been different.</i>

170
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:53,313
Describe species.

171
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,581
Got some more bread.

172
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:55,819
- Anyone want some?
-Thank you.

173
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,088
<i>This one definitely
keeps me on my toes.</i>

174
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:01,859
<i>There's six kids, six months to 17.</i>

175
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:03,733
<i>But that's okay.</i>

176
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:07,428
<i>I prefer it that way. It's better to stay busy.</i>

177
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:10,474
I think someone's gonna go to bed.
So everyone say good night.

178
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,873
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night.

179
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,446
What makes the job
a Jot easier, though...

180
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,145
Hey, everybody, gather in.

181
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:26,122
...is <i>when you genuinely like
the women that you work for.</i>

182
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:29,125
- Okay, is everybody here?
-Hey, Luna, how's it going?

183
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:30,251
- Hi, Violet.
-Hey.

184
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:32,023
Doesn't look like you're gonna be cold today.

185
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:35,588
<i>Iris is really easygoing and kind.</i>

186
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:41,996
<i>And she has this way about her that...</i>

187
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:44,507
Balls, we need balls.

188
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:46,342
<i>It's hard to describe.</i>

189
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:50,207
- See your sister? Hi!
- Over here.

190
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:54,547
All I know is that when I'm around her, I feel

191
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:58,415
at ease.

192
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:01,185
Saffron, move in!

193
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,451
<i>Tends more conservative.</i>

194
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,326
<i>She likes to do things by the book.</i>

195
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:12,130
Remember the play, girls,
just like in practice!

196
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:16,333
<i>So when she's around,
I tend to keep a low profile.</i>

197
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:19,706
<i>I do my job, and I stay out of the way.</i>

198
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,140
Because at the end of the day,

199
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:25,546
no matter how emotionally involved
I might get,

200
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:27,242
I'm an employee.

201
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,187
And it's good to be reminded of that
every once in a while.

202
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:33,450
There he is, the whippersnapper.

203
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:35,492
- Hey, Jim, how are you?
-Good, good.

204
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:36,583
You know Reggie?

205
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,890
He works for Holly Dawson
and Ivy Chan up on Verona.

206
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:40,897
Sure, yeah.

207
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:43,797
And my bosses want me
to put on a magic show to boot.

208
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:45,233
Can you believe that?

209
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,532
As if I can just summon up balloon animals.

210
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:51,871
I want to say, "Ladies, I put on
a magic show for you every single day.

211
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:54,502
"I toilet trained your daughters,
for God's sake."

212
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:56,906
Excuse me?

213
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,471
Can you keep your voices down?

214
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:01,245
Nobody wants to listen
to a bunch of manosaurs.

215
00:14:03,576 --> 00:14:05,385
It's so annoying.

216
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:07,048
Sorry, we were just talking.

217
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:09,786
- Yeah, relax.
-Don't tell me to relax.

218
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,487
You're not even allowed to be here.

219
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,224
- It's okay, we're actually working.
-It doesn't matter.

220
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:16,323
You can't congregate
in groups of more than two.

221
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:19,392
- Or have you forgotten that?
-Oh, come on, seriously?

222
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:20,937
Those are the rules.

223
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:23,371
Are you going to follow them or not?

224
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,102
It's okay. I got to get back to work.

225
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:26,643
No, no. Don't go. Stick around.

226
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,839
It's okay. It's not worth it.
It was good seeing you. I'll see you soon.

227
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:31,404
See you later.

228
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:37,782
<i>Maybe if things
had turned out differently,</i>

229
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:41,017
<i>I'd be a pilot or an architect like my mom.</i>

230
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:46,925
<i>But there's no point in dwelling on that.</i>

231
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:50,297
<i>I'm gonna make the best
of the opportunities that I do have,</i>

232
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:54,099
<i>because things aren't going to change.</i>

233
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:56,773
<i>Not back to the way they were.</i>

234
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:01,572
That's just a fact of nature.

235
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:12,044
<i>Even though more and more women
were coming forward</i>

236
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:13,647
<i>with fatherless pregnancy claims,</i>

237
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:15,988
<i>they weren't taken seriously.</i>

238
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:20,319
<i>So things seemed to carry on
as they always had.</i>

239
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:24,968
<i>I think there was a sense
that it was pointless.</i>

240
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:30,237
<i>We tried to tell them what was going on,
but they didn't want to listen.</i>

241
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:33,874
They never listened.

242
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:37,437
But if you'd looked a little closer,
you would have seen that

243
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:42,350
<i>beneath the woman’s dutiful,
prim and proper exteriors,</i>

244
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:46,788
<i>there was a simmering anger
getting ready to boil over.</i>

245
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,651
And then Sister Isabella came along.

246
00:15:55,154 --> 00:16:01,036
<i>She was living in a convent in the hills
outside of a small town in Northern Spain.</i>

247
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:05,708
<i>Men were strictly forbidden
from entering the convent,</i>

248
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:08,040
<i>and even if she had wanted
to break her vows,</i>

249
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:12,442
<i>given the remote location
and the watchfulness of the other nuns,</i>

250
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:15,383
<i>it would have been impossible
for her to sneak away.</i>

251
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:20,380
<i>Yet, Sister Isabella discovered,
to her utter dismay</i>

252
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:25,921
<i>that she was pregnant.</i>

253
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:32,601
<i>One could argue that
if this had happened in a different time,</i>

254
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,867
<i>the Church may have very well
embraced Sister Isabella,</i>

255
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:38,033
<i>canonized her as a living saint,</i>

256
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:42,375
<i>and perhaps even looked upon her baby
as the return of their Messiah.</i>

257
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:45,475
But then again, she had a daughter,

258
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:49,280
so that would have thrown a wrench
into the Biblical narrative, wouldn't it?

259
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:59,723
<i>All we do know is that the Church wanted
nothing to do with Sister Isabella.</i>

260
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:04,964
<i>The Congregation of Causes of Saints
was ordered to destroy</i>

261
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,867
<i>the report they had written,</i>

262
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:10,764
<i>and deny that they had ever heard her claim.</i>

263
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:18,872
<i>They told us
it was for the best.</i>

264
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,653
<i>In the tiny village
of Burgos, Spain,</i>

265
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,954
<i>a group of nuns are telling a whale of a story.</i>

266
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:32,558
<i>Meet Sister Isabella.</i>

267
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:36,065
<i>Though it's hard to tell with that habit on,
she's pregnant.</i>

268
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:38,795
<i>And guess who they're saying the father is?</i>

269
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:39,926
<i>No one.</i>

270
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:43,269
<i>That's right,
it's another so-called fatherless pregnancy.</i>

271
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:45,865
<i>The last thing the Catholic Church
expected was that</i>

272
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:51,176
a devout order of Spanish nuns
would not only break their vow of silence,

273
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:54,080
but start talking to anyone who would listen.

274
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,826
<i>You people think
that this is a joke, but it is not.</i>

275
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:12,164
<i>It is happening more and more,
and the government needs to acknowledge it.</i>

276
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:15,171
<i>They need to wake up
and take these claims seriously</i>

277
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:17,298
<i>or they are going to be sorry.</i>

278
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:22,573
<i>We would like women everywhere to know
that despite the world's scientific community</i>

279
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:27,447
<i>being unanimous in their belief
that fatherless pregnancies are impossible,</i>

280
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:30,350
<i>we intend to study this matter vigorously.</i>

281
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:33,549
<i>And I have no doubt that,
one way or another,</i>

282
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:37,856
<i>we will be able to put this whole matter
to rest once and for all.</i>

283
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:45,333
<i>For as long as history
has been recorded we have seen,</i>

284
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,303
<i>with civilization after civilization,</i>

285
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:53,275
<i>that once a group attains power,
they are very reluctant to give it up.</i>

286
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:58,213
But history also shows us that eventually
they are always forced to.

287
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,379
<i>Tell us what you saw earlier.</i>

288
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,442
<i>Well, really it's what I didn't see.</i>

289
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:06,490
When I came <i>into</i> work this morning,
there were <i>no</i> secretaries,

290
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:09,422
<i>which is unusual,
given how many of them we have.</i>

291
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,461
<i>And since there was no one
to make me coffee,</i>

292
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,554
<i>I had to go all the way down to the lobby.</i>

293
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:15,530
<i>But then it took me 20 minutes to get service</i>

294
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:18,761
because the waitresses
hadn't shown <i>up</i> for work there, either.

295
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,464
Afterwards, it was referred to as a strike.

296
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:23,404
But it wasn't an organized event.

297
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:27,499
My mother wasn't even aware
that other women were doing the same thing.

298
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,770
One night, she just decided
that she'd had enough.

299
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:37,345
<i>My father and brother and I
were in the dining room</i>

300
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,514
<i>waiting for dinner to be served.</i>

301
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:41,717
<i>And I noticed she wasn't in the kitchen.</i>

302
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:44,718
<i>And it didn't seem like
any food was being prepared.</i>

303
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:49,554
<i>Then she appeared with a coat on
and her purse in her hand and said...</i>

304
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:50,964
I'm going out.

305
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,525
I don't know when I'll be back.

306
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:56,471
If you want dinner,
you'll have to make it yourselves.

307
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:59,441
I think there's some
ground beef in the freezer.

308
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:02,243
<i>And it was really
out of character for her</i>

309
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:03,336
<i>to be doing something like that.</i>

310
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:08,609
<i>But it wasn't until I turned
and saw the look on my father's face</i>

311
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:12,349
<i>that I realized that something
significant was happening.</i>

312
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,835
I have to admit, I was impressed
that he was able to swallow his pride

313
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,132
and ask me to take him back.

314
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:33,404
<i>But then I suddenly had this realization</i>

315
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:38,712
<i>that! had absolutely
no use for him in my life.</i>

316
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:53,154
<i>I love everything Iris paints.</i>

317
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:57,731
<i>I always have.</i>

318
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:03,570
<i>But I'm biased, because we're so close.</i>

319
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:10,277
And when you really like someone,
you tend to like everything they do.

320
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:11,507
Uh...

321
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:15,717
Am I as crazy about
this man phase she's been in?

322
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,187
Maybe not.

323
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:21,053
But they're still beautiful paintings.

324
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:37,632
<i>I don't think people
acknowledge the issue enough.</i>

325
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:40,368
<i>I mean, most don't acknowledge it at all.</i>

326
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:46,282
<i>But painlessness is something
that really concerns me,</i>

327
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:50,881
<i>which, I guess, is why I've been making it
such a part of my work lately.</i>

328
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:55,287
Because I want to keep the issue alive.

329
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:59,420
I guess it's my way of making people
confront what's going on.

330
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:20,212
<i>The paintings don't sell nearly
as well as my other pieces.</i>

331
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,020
Actually, they don't sell at all.

332
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:28,146
Nobody wants a picture of a man
hanging over their fireplace.

333
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:40,034
<i>It isn't Andrew's age
and what that represents.</i>

334
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,399
<i>He just...</i>

335
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:46,598
He has this way about him that I like.

336
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:54,279
<i>I notice her staring at him a lot,
but it kind of makes sense.</i>

337
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:58,044
If you're gonna spend
all that time painting someone,

338
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:01,216
you should probably
really like looking at them.

339
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:07,063
You think I'm obsessed with him.

340
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:08,792
I'm not.

341
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:11,394
It's just part of my process.

342
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:18,168
<i>It doesn't matter what my subject is.</i>

343
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,974
Mmm. It's good.

344
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:22,636
- Are you being serious?
-Yeah, it's good.

345
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:26,911
And it's not like there's
a lot of other men around for me to paint.

346
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,908
And he does live with us.

347
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:37,716
Here is it.

348
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:41,225
I did it for art class. Um...

349
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:45,200
It's not perfect or anything.

350
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:48,527
I wasn't concerned with likeness so much.

351
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:51,005
I was more interested in his body,

352
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:55,310
his muscles, especially in his arms.

353
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:58,908
I really like his arms.

354
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,852
My grandma used to say
about my grandfather

355
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:09,415
that it wasn't his looks

356
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:12,519
or even his personality
that caught her attention at first,

357
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:14,188
it was his spirit.

358
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,333
And that's what I'm trying to capture
in my paintings,

359
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,427
Andrew's spirit.

360
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:25,373
And maybe, by extension,
the spirit that exists in all men.

361
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:33,712
<i>As the number of fatherless
pregnancy claims continued to rise,</i>

362
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:36,719
<i>we discovered that the number
of normal pregnancies,</i>

363
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:40,484
<i>in which a man impregnated a woman,
was plummeting.</i>

364
00:24:41,112 --> 00:24:45,219
<i>In fact, by the end of 1957,
three out of four babies born</i>

365
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:49,231
<i>were coming from mothers claiming
to have had a fatherless impregnation.</i>

366
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:52,430
What was even more alarming, though,

367
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:57,167
was the fact that every one of those mothers
gave birth to a girl.

368
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:03,908
Parthenogenesis.

369
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:08,106
It's the reason why we get called.
You know, instead of how it used to be

370
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,278
when you needed to be
with a man to get pregnant.

371
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,151
What? It's true.

372
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:15,054
That's disgusting.

373
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,355
Parthenogenesis is a form
of asexual reproduction

374
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:22,261
<i>in which an egg is the sole source
of genetic material</i>

375
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,731
<i>for the creation of an embryo.</i>

376
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:28,835
<i>But this mode of reproduction
was only known to occur</i>

377
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:31,670
<i>with insects and certain types of reptiles.</i>

378
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,604
<i>With mammals, however,</i>

379
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:42,213
<i>an embryo could only develop
if the egg had been fertilized by a male,</i>

380
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:47,480
<i>bringing together the genetic components
that make life possible.</i>

381
00:25:48,446 --> 00:25:52,223
But with parthenogenesis,
since all the necessary components

382
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:55,527
needed for reproduction
are produced by the egg,

383
00:25:57,188 --> 00:26:00,658
<i>sperm are rendered obsolete.</i>

384
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,206
Not only that, but we discovered

385
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:07,106
the sperm could no longer
penetrate the wall of the egg.

386
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:12,046
<i>It was producing a new protein
that hardened the membrane.</i>

387
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:15,479
<i>The sperm were literally being shutout.</i>

388
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,823
<i>Even when a sperm was injected
into the egg artificially,</i>

389
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,884
<i>it was almost immediately rendered inert.</i>

390
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:38,099
When you take sperm
out of the biological equation,

391
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:40,165
there are no longer any Y chromosomes

392
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:43,041
<i>being introduced
into the embryonic process.</i>

393
00:26:44,502 --> 00:26:49,679
<i>So every embryo has two X chromosomes
and every child is female.</i>

394
00:26:51,476 --> 00:26:52,682
<i>And thus,</i>

395
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:55,123
no more males.

396
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:04,229
<i>It wasn't hard for them
to figure out that I was the last one.</i>

397
00:27:06,324 --> 00:27:10,830
<i>I was actually the only boy born that year
in the entire world.</i>

398
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:16,611
But they didn't make it official
until a few years later,

399
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:19,979
when they were sure that there
wasn't any more of us coming.

400
00:27:23,508 --> 00:27:26,318
<i>When I started school, I got a lot of attention.</i>

401
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:30,058
<i>I was kind of like the class pet.</i>

402
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:33,122
<i>Not in a bad way.</i>

403
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:36,825
<i>It wasn't like I was being
kept in a cage like Mr. Chips.</i>

404
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:40,899
He was the actual class pet.

405
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:45,108
<i>High school was more of a challenge.</i>

406
00:27:46,097 --> 00:27:49,010
<i>By that point, girls were so used
to not having boys around</i>

407
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:53,846
<i>that the idea of being attracted to one
was completely alien to them.</i>

408
00:27:55,974 --> 00:27:58,614
Don't get me wrong,
there were some crooked girls,

409
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,856
um, more than there are now, I'm sure.

410
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:05,354
<i>But they weren't accepted by the other girls.</i>

411
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:09,697
<i>But neither was I, so we got along just fine.</i>

412
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:15,067
<i>It really wasn't until I finished high school</i>

413
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:18,005
<i>that I realized how different
things were going to be for me,</i>

414
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:20,942
<i>compared to the girls I graduated with.</i>

415
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,972
That's when it finally dawned on me that

416
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:28,313
I wasn't gonna have the same
opportunities that they were going to.

417
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,784
They were going down one road

418
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,550
and I was going down another.

419
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:42,296
<i>I, Eleanor Marie Hamilton,
do solemnly swear...</i>

420
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:44,458
<i>That I will faithfully execute...</i>

421
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:46,331
<i>That I will faithfully execute...</i>

422
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,962
<i>The office of
the President of the United States.</i>

423
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:51,337
<i>The office of
the President of the United States.</i>

424
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,103
<i>And with the best of my ability...</i>

425
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:56,907
<i>If you had told someone
in the early 1960s</i>

426
00:28:56,968 --> 00:29:01,041
<i>that a woman would be
the next President of the United States,</i>

427
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:03,086
<i>they wouldn't have believed you.</i>

428
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:06,478
It may seem ridiculous now, but at that time,

429
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:10,321
people thought they'd have to wait 10,
or possibly even 15 years,

430
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:12,258
before that would happen.

431
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:16,629
The changes weren't that drastic,
at least not at first.

432
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:19,499
It's not like they came out
and declared war on men

433
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:21,468
or anything like that.

434
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:26,305
But I don't think it would be a stretch to say
that there was an element of payback

435
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:28,344
in their governing agenda.

436
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,277
<i>We very much appreciate
the historical contribution</i>

437
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:34,977
<i>that men have made to our civilization.</i>

438
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,144
<i>But the facts are the facts.</i>

439
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:40,382
<i>Women make up 62% of the population.
And that...</i>

440
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,686
<i>Actually, Senator, it's 64% now.</i>

441
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:43,953
<i>Right.</i>

442
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:47,553
<i>And that ratio needs to be represented
in all levels of society.</i>

443
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,826
<i>But isn't your worker replacement program</i>

444
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:53,495
<i>-a little harsh? These statistics...
-Worker assessment program.</i>

445
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:57,096
We only <i>allow</i> male employees to be replaced

446
00:29:57,162 --> 00:29:59,836
<i>if, after a very thorough assessment,</i>

447
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:04,347
<i>they are deemed to be less capable
than an equally qualified female.</i>

448
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:07,278
<i>It's simply a weeding out process.</i>

449
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:10,811
<i>And there just happens to be a lot of weeds.</i>

450
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:17,793
<i>My grandfather,
he warned that this would happen.</i>

451
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:20,762
<i>He said we never should have
given women the vote.</i>

452
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:24,631
<i>He said, uh, "You give them an inch,
and they'll take your soul."</i>

453
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:27,329
<i>You know what? He was right.</i>

454
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:35,539
<i>Generally speaking, men did not
react well to female-led governments.</i>

455
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,843
<i>More and more of them began to opt out</i>

456
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:43,909
and move to rural encampments
in what we now refer to as "the Exodus."

457
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:48,984
<i>We are not welcome here, so why stay?</i>

458
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:51,252
<i>You know?</i>

459
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:53,956
<i>We'll see how they get along without us,</i>

460
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,827
<i>because I don't think
it's going to be too long</i>

461
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:59,562
<i>before they realize the mistake they made
and then beg us to come back.</i>

462
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:01,103
<i>Hey, jackass!</i>

463
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:02,904
<i>You forgot your coat.</i>

464
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:06,932
<i>Kind of an important item to leave behind
when you're gonna live in the woods.</i>

465
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:19,248
<i>I was living with these three women,
and they were all beautiful and free loving.</i>

466
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:23,283
<i>Then they started treating me
like a sex object</i>

467
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,525
<i>and their errand boy.</i>

468
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:33,697
<i>By the mid-1970s, it was clear</i>

469
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:37,399
<i>that women were doing just fine
without men in charge.</i>

470
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:44,344
<i>This caused a lot of the men who had left
to rethink their positions.</i>

471
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:49,944
<i>Some returned and took on
more subservient roles.</i>

472
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:55,856
But a core group dug in their heels
and refused to accept the new world order.

473
00:31:56,481 --> 00:32:00,258
<i>It's simple, okay? Power, respect.</i>

474
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:04,289
<i>That's what's been taken away from us,
and that's what we intend to get back.</i>

475
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:09,303
<i>It's not called "womankind."
It's called "mankind."</i>

476
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,737
<i>And there's a reason for that,</i>

477
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:14,140
<i>because for the last 200,000 years,</i>

478
00:32:14,198 --> 00:32:17,202
<i>men have been keeping civilization afloat.</i>

479
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:21,114
<i>We've been steering the ship.
We built the ship.</i>

480
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:25,018
<i>And now they want to chuck us overboard
because their eggs have gone haywire?</i>

481
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:27,316
<i>Not bloody likely.</i>

482
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:29,016
<i>- What do we want?
- Respect!</i>

483
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,616
<i>- When do we want it?
- Now!</i>

484
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:32,161
<i>- What do we want?
Respect!</i>

485
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:33,786
<i>- When do we want it?
-Now!</i>

486
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:36,331
<i>The protests
tied up traffic throughout the city,</i>

487
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:39,334
<i>which is believed to be what
ultimately sparked the violence.</i>

488
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:41,336
<i>Women just started getting out of their cars</i>

489
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:43,668
<i>and coming at us with this...
This look in their eyes.</i>

490
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:48,335
<i>Get out of the street!</i>

491
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:52,506
<i>I was trying to get to work,
but the traffic was stopped dead.</i>

492
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:56,484
<i>And then I saw the men
blocking the road and chanting.</i>

493
00:32:57,608 --> 00:32:59,281
<i>And I snapped.</i>

494
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:06,261
<i>Protest marches took place
all over the world that day.</i>

495
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,432
At first, it was thought that the violence
was connected to parthenogenesis.

496
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:16,665
That nature was compensating
for the loss of men

497
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:19,208
by making women more aggressive.

498
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:21,543
But in fact, it was PMS.

499
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,474
<i>By 1975, women represented</i>

500
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:29,381
<i>over three-quarters
of the world's population.</i>

501
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:34,448
<i>This triggered what's known as
"menstrual ovulatory synchrony,"</i>

502
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:35,855
<i>which is a phenomenon</i>

503
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:39,156
<i>where the menstrual cycles of women
become synchronized.</i>

504
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:44,458
So essentially, the world became
like one big sorority house.

505
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:47,562
<i>This is just the tip of the iceberg.</i>

506
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:53,139
<i>First their bodies get in sync.
Pretty soon, it'll be their minds.</i>

507
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,175
<i>Telepathic communication.</i>

508
00:33:56,934 --> 00:33:58,709
<i>How do you contend with that?</i>

509
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,447
<i>You can't.</i>

510
00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:03,317
<i>You can't compete with the hive mind.</i>

511
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:11,024
<i>The protest marches and the ensuing
violence turned out to be a watershed event.</i>

512
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:13,585
It was the catalyst for creating a monthly,

513
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:17,394
three-day statutory holiday
we now know as "Menses."

514
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:22,404
But more importantly,
the protests happened right after unification.

515
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,464
So it was the first test

516
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:27,510
for the newly formed
World Governing Council.

517
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:32,378
<i>And everyone was watching very closely
to see how they would respond.</i>

518
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:34,576
<i>First of all, I want to make it clear</i>

519
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,382
<i>that the World Governing Council,
above all, listens.</i>

520
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:42,551
<i>We want men's groups everywhere
to know we have heard you.</i>

521
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:46,494
<i>We acknowledge your plight
and we're going to help you.</i>

522
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:49,191
<i>As part of our commitment</i>

523
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:52,723
<i>to ensuring the safety
and comfort of men everywhere,</i>

524
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:57,068
<i>the World Governing Council
has set aside vast areas of land</i>

525
00:34:57,128 --> 00:35:00,541
<i>for the creation of male sanctuaries.</i>

526
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:06,040
<i>These exclusive communities
will be located all over the world,</i>

527
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:09,517
<i>including the entire continent of Australia.</i>

528
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:13,783
<i>Men who live in these sanctuaries
will be provided</i>

529
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:18,316
<i>all the services they require,
including medical attention,</i>

530
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:21,420
<i>nutritious meals, clean clothes,</i>

531
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:24,057
<i>and of course, entertainment.</i>

532
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:35,043
<i>We believe that the remaining men
should be kept as comfortable as possible</i>

533
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:36,737
<i>as they live out their lives.</i>

534
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:42,012
<i>And that their contribution to humanity
must be, and will be, respected and honored.</i>

535
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:47,985
<i>But, at the same time, we must respect
and honor nature's actions.</i>

536
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:49,814
<i>Praise nature.</i>

537
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:53,295
<i>Do they think we're children?</i>

538
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:57,231
<i>Offering us food
and a bunch of silly conveniences.</i>

539
00:35:57,288 --> 00:36:01,293
<i>It is a blatant attempt
by this female regime to pacify us.</i>

540
00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:03,767
<i>We're not stupid.</i>

541
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:06,399
<i>They can ply us with
all the comforts in the world,</i>

542
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:09,570
<i>but it will not change our resolve.</i>

543
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:13,878
<i>Because they may have taken away
our rightful place in society.</i>

544
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:17,283
<i>They will not take away our dignity.</i>

545
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:20,379
While there's no question
the MLO had a defiant spirit

546
00:36:20,444 --> 00:36:23,448
and were very vocal about their intentions,

547
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:26,427
they actually didn't do much
once the Governing Council

548
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:30,330
established the sanctuaries
and began providing services.

549
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:31,628
<i>That's rubbish.</i>

550
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:34,465
<i>Living in the sanctuaries
has not made us weak.</i>

551
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:38,473
<i>What it has done is given us
the ability to plan our resurgence</i>

552
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,668
<i>as the dominant, superior sex</i>

553
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:44,406
<i>without the hassle of having to
prepare meals or take care of ourselves.</i>

554
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:52,484
<i>Don't you see? The joke is on them.</i>

555
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:57,724
All this time, the regime have believed
that they've been weakening our resolve.

556
00:36:57,782 --> 00:37:00,695
But what they've actually
been doing is allowing us

557
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:03,061
to focus on our plan of attack.

558
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,033
And it won't be long
before we're ready to strike.

559
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:10,835
I don't think the issue is whether or not
the MLO is an effective organization.

560
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:14,172
It's the fact that their central goal
can't be achieved.

561
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:19,245
Not when the government firmly believes
that there's no solution to the problem.

562
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:22,079
They don't even see
manlessness as a problem.

563
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,980
To them, it's simply an evolutionary event,

564
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:30,617
an act of nature that's beyond our control
and should never be questioned,

565
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:33,416
because nature is sacred.

566
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:36,864
Notice the energy rising up your body,

567
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,060
higher and higher.

568
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:43,695
Feel the power flowing up
through your fingertips.

569
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:49,778
Breathe it in.

570
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:52,815
<i>It wasn't enough
that they took away our jobs.</i>

571
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:54,611
<i>They went and fired God, too.</i>

572
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:59,587
Worshipping the sacred
cycles of her forces.

573
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,224
<i>Replaced him with a sheila.</i>

574
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,557
That's nature flowing through you.

575
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,687
Praise nature.

576
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:10,198
But you can't question her actions,

577
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:12,894
because everything she does
is a blessed gift.

578
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:15,733
Influenza was an act of nature.

579
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,607
So was malaria and cancer.

580
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:26,175
<i>But they're not around anymore.
And not because nature eradicated them,</i>

581
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:30,686
<i>but because the government spent
trillions of dollars developing vaccines.</i>

582
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:34,413
I'm not suggesting that
the Governing Council has been

583
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:37,516
avoiding dealing with
the painlessness issue on purpose

584
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:39,891
as a way to maintain power,

585
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:43,625
even though having men die off
would certainly achieve that goal.

586
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:46,032
But I do think it's worth asking the question.

587
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:50,000
Why haven't more resources
been put towards it?

588
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:54,406
There's no doubt in my mind
that the government have been

589
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:57,173
deliberately ignoring the problem.

590
00:38:57,234 --> 00:39:02,047
They're using nature as an excuse
to push their number one agenda,

591
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:04,516
doing away with men.

592
00:39:04,575 --> 00:39:07,021
They go on believing that they don't need us,

593
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:11,220
but that's just another example
of their reckless, short-term way of thinking.

594
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:17,197
Being women, they can't think strategically.
They're incapable of seeing the big picture.

595
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:20,791
<i>I'll give you an example.</i>

596
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:25,637
<i>In 1960, the U.S. Defense Department
was all set to fund a program</i>

597
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,233
<i>that would allow the computers
all around the world</i>

598
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:29,642
to connect with each other.

599
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:33,614
They'd have been linked together
in a massive communication web.

600
00:39:34,071 --> 00:39:36,813
Could you imagine
if all our word processing units

601
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,717
could talk to each other?

602
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:41,017
Bloody amazing, right?

603
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:44,252
Well, women take over and guess what?

604
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:50,261
<i>The U.S. Defense budget gets stuffed.</i>

605
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:56,405
Don't even getting me started
on space exploration.

606
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:59,634
They gutted NASA in the early 1960s,

607
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:02,803
and the Russian program
didn't stand a chance, either.

608
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:05,245
<i>I really don't understand
this obsession they have</i>

609
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:07,282
<i>with putting a man on the moon.</i>

610
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:10,615
<i>We all appreciate the important role
it plays in our lives,</i>

611
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:15,487
<i>but do we really need to go to the trouble
of sending someone up there to stand on it?</i>

612
00:40:16,313 --> 00:40:18,486
<i>I don't think so.</i>

613
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:22,292
<i>Now, if we had a way to
put all of the men on the moon...</i>

614
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,995
So what do we have to show

615
00:40:25,055 --> 00:40:28,867
for all these massive spending cuts
and program cancellations?

616
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:32,806
World peace and electric cars.
Big bloody deal.

617
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:41,347
<i>True progress only comes about
through conflict.</i>

618
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:44,810
<i>Used to be a time when
one country fancied another,</i>

619
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:46,718
<i>they'd invade it.</i>

620
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:51,089
War was declared, and they battled it out
until one of them was defeated.

621
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:54,686
And a bigger, stronger nation
was born out of it.

622
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:56,060
<i>Dale?</i>

623
00:40:57,888 --> 00:40:59,629
<i>I was just fixing my hair.</i>

624
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:03,035
<i>Used to be a time,
if a man fancied a woman,</i>

625
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:05,573
<i>he'd court her, tum on the charm.</i>

626
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,370
<i>...but I'd rather look at you.</i>

627
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:09,138
<i>You're beautiful, Connie.</i>

628
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,204
Until she had no choice but to fall for it.

629
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:14,840
And they'd get together, and they'd have sex.

630
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:16,009
<i>Intercourse.</i>

631
00:41:16,073 --> 00:41:18,383
That's a form of conflict.

632
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:22,413
And out of that came children.
True progress.

633
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:25,419
NOW?

634
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:29,021
We live in a world
where there's no wars, no.

635
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:44,069
<i>I remember when my parents
told me I was the last boy.</i>

636
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:49,717
I started wondering if maybe
I was the cause of the problem.

637
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:54,846
That somehow I had stopped
any more of us from coming out.

638
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,588
Like maybe I had broken
the machinery or something.

639
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:03,295
Uh, or that God had taken one look at me
and said, "That's it, I'm done with males."

640
00:42:07,157 --> 00:42:10,070
<i>Even though
we still don't know for certain,</i>

641
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:14,337
<i>a consensus has emerged as to
what caused the extinction of the dinosaurs.</i>

642
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:19,004
<i>The same will be true with men.</i>

643
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:21,242
Until the cause is discovered,

644
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:25,447
a dominant theory will emerge
and become conventional wisdom.

645
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:29,184
My personal feeling? It's evolution.

646
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,856
Humans evolved from the apes

647
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:34,954
and now we're evolving further
into a single sex.

648
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:36,498
But why?

649
00:42:37,454 --> 00:42:39,092
Why would nature do that?

650
00:42:39,156 --> 00:42:42,194
We just don't need them anymore. That's all.

651
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,240
It's not as if we're a hunter-gatherer society.

652
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:49,767
We don't need men to protect us
or hunt for food or build shelters.

653
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,977
And since they aren't needed anymore,
nature just stopped producing them.

654
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:55,676
It's nothing personal.

655
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,241
It's the <i>penis.</i>

656
00:42:57,308 --> 00:43:02,519
It was responsible for the skyscrapers,
the missiles, the oil drills,

657
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:06,223
and eventually all of that
aggressive, phallic energy

658
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:08,786
had such a corroding effect on the planet

659
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:11,765
that nature had no choice
but to extinguish it.

660
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:14,359
<i>You know what a NEO is?</i>

661
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,063
<i>Near Earth object.</i>

662
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:19,164
<i>Now normally, they're comets or asteroids.</i>

663
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:24,802
<i>Well, in 1952, astronomers recorded one
that they thought was an asteroid.</i>

664
00:43:25,669 --> 00:43:28,377
<i>But due to an unusually large
cloud of solar debris</i>

665
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:31,352
<i>that was surrounding it,
there was no way to be sure.</i>

666
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:38,883
<i>Nine months later,
the first so-called fatherless baby was born.</i>

667
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:43,493
Women have two X chromosomes,
men only have one,

668
00:43:43,554 --> 00:43:47,400
which would be okay if our Y chromosome
had something to offer.

669
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:50,900
But the fact is, it pales in comparison.

670
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:53,775
It only carries a tiny complement of genes

671
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:57,005
and it offers no protection
against genetic mutations.

672
00:43:58,068 --> 00:44:00,480
It's kind of a runty little thing.

673
00:44:01,772 --> 00:44:05,584
And I suspect that's ultimately
what's doing us in.

674
00:44:05,743 --> 00:44:08,053
<i>Why wouldn't there be female aliens?</i>

675
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:11,718
<i>A race of asexual, female aliens</i>

676
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:16,097
<i>that come to Earth
to hijack our reproductive system.</i>

677
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:18,064
<i>And do you want to know
why the government</i>

678
00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:19,897
<i>doesn't have an explanation?</i>

679
00:44:19,957 --> 00:44:22,460
<i>Because if they admitted
they knew what the cause was,</i>

680
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:25,905
<i>they'd be that much closer
to being able to fix it.</i>

681
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:29,570
<i>So either they don't want to know
and they've got their heads stuck in the sand,</i>

682
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:32,910
<i>or they do know
and they're hiding the truth from us.</i>

683
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:36,577
<i>Either way, they're avoiding
dealing with the situation.</i>

684
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,085
<i>Men aren't like that, are they?</i>

685
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:39,621
<i>- No.
-No! No.</i>

686
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,918
<i>When we see a problem, we attack it.</i>

687
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:45,290
<i>We tear it apart until we know
everything there is to know about it.</i>

688
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:46,987
<i>And then what do we do?</i>

689
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:48,792
<i>- We fix it!
- We fix it!</i>

690
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:53,301
<i>We don't form committees or talking circles
or go on listening tours.</i>

691
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:55,428
<i>- We fix it.
MEN". Fix it! Fix it!</i>

692
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:57,938
<i>And that's exactly what we're gonna do.</i>

693
00:44:57,995 --> 00:45:01,807
<i>We're gonna get back into power
and put an end to painlessness.</i>

694
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:04,243
<i>Fix it! Fix it! Fix it!</i>

695
00:45:04,301 --> 00:45:06,679
<i>-- Fix m Fix m Fix m</i>

696
00:45:06,737 --> 00:45:08,614
<i>Fix it! Fix it! Fix it!</i>

697
00:45:10,274 --> 00:45:13,778
<i>I just received some
very important information.</i>

698
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:15,881
<i>They're sewing tenderloin
in the mess hall tonight</i>

699
00:45:15,946 --> 00:45:17,152
<i>and they're sewing it right now.</i>

700
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:19,057
Come on! Let's go.

701
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:28,527
<i>I realize now it was
a kind of survivor's guilt that I was feeling.</i>

702
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:33,231
<i>And even though it's totally crazy,
I still feel twinges of it.</i>

703
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:36,673
It's usually when I see
other men looking at me,

704
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:41,908
and I think they blame me
for being the last one out the door.

705
00:45:44,374 --> 00:45:46,786
"What did you do? What did you do?"

706
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:50,287
I don't feel good about it.

707
00:45:51,115 --> 00:45:53,186
But I don't feel bad, either.

708
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:56,863
It's not like they're being massacred.

709
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,958
They're just getting old and dying off.

710
00:46:00,824 --> 00:46:04,135
It's like, I remember reading
in the paper a while ago

711
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:07,334
that the last surviving member
of this rock band had died.

712
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:10,276
They were called The Raymonds, I think.

713
00:46:10,334 --> 00:46:12,075
The Ramones?

714
00:46:12,136 --> 00:46:15,242
Right. Anyway, I remember feeling sad.

715
00:46:16,173 --> 00:46:18,619
But not for all the members of the band,

716
00:46:18,675 --> 00:46:21,383
or because they wouldn't
be producing any new songs,

717
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,550
but because someone had died.

718
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,059
That's always sad,

719
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:28,395
but that's also a part of life.

720
00:46:29,353 --> 00:46:31,060
Nothing is forever.

721
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:37,129
You're comparing the extinction of men
to a punk band from the '70s?

722
00:46:38,695 --> 00:46:40,868
It's actually kind of the same thing.

723
00:46:41,665 --> 00:46:46,478
One day, I'm going to open up the paper
and find out that the last man has died.

724
00:46:47,404 --> 00:46:51,784
And I think I'm going to feel the same way
that I did about The Raymonds.

725
00:46:55,612 --> 00:46:57,250
Hi, I'm so excited to meet you.

726
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:59,225
- I loved your book.
-So nice to meet you.

727
00:46:59,283 --> 00:47:01,786
- Nice to meet you.
-What's your name?

728
00:47:01,852 --> 00:47:07,632
<i>Imagine if the entire planet
was exposed to sunlight 24 hours a day.</i>

729
00:47:09,459 --> 00:47:13,532
<i>It would never get dark, so we wouldn't have
any use for the word "night."</i>

730
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:16,502
The same is true for the word "gender."

731
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:20,242
Once men are gone,
it will cease to have any meaning.

732
00:47:20,304 --> 00:47:24,047
And good riddance.
It's the most divisive word in human history.

733
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:28,180
But doing away with gender does not mean
we have to do away with sex.

734
00:47:38,722 --> 00:47:41,931
<i>Despite what the government
would have us believe,</i>

735
00:47:41,992 --> 00:47:44,268
<i>women still crave sexual intimacy,</i>

736
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:50,243
<i>just as we're still instinctively pairing off
in order to raise our children.</i>

737
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:52,075
<i>Because without intimacy,</i>

738
00:47:52,135 --> 00:47:56,174
the bond that holds a couple together
will eventually start to disintegrate.

739
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,379
And then their families will disintegrate,

740
00:47:58,442 --> 00:48:01,651
and then where does that
leave our society as a whole?

741
00:48:03,647 --> 00:48:05,854
<i>But the government
hasn't embraced this rationale.</i>

742
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:08,487
<i>In fact, the members
of the Governing Council</i>

743
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:11,192
<i>are these out-of-touch conservatives</i>

744
00:48:11,255 --> 00:48:13,997
<i>who harbor an irrational fear
of a male resurgence.</i>

745
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:17,195
And this paranoia has trickled down

746
00:48:17,261 --> 00:48:19,935
into the bedrock of
the government's social policy,

747
00:48:19,997 --> 00:48:22,307
which explains why it's so extreme.

748
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:27,614
They've turned their fear of heterosexuality
into a fear of any kind of sex at all.

749
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:31,514
<i>Mom, can I ask you something?</i>

750
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:33,521
<i>of course, dear. What is it?</i>

751
00:48:34,278 --> 00:48:38,283
<i>Is it strange that when
I touch myself, you know,</i>

752
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:42,455
<i>down there, that it feels really good?</i>

753
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:48,234
<i>Have you
found yourself in this situation?</i>

754
00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:50,795
<i>or perhaps it's a conversation
you're dreading?</i>

755
00:48:51,828 --> 00:48:54,638
<i>Well, don't worry, you're not alone.</i>

756
00:48:54,698 --> 00:49:00,478
<i>The fact is, as girls reach puberty,
the joy and excitement of impending fertility</i>

757
00:49:00,537 --> 00:49:05,509
<i>can often be accompanied by
the confusion and perils of sexual arousal.</i>

758
00:49:05,575 --> 00:49:07,486
<i>The Department of Health
has produced this video...</i>

759
00:49:07,544 --> 00:49:11,287
I think what you have to understand
is that these are confusing times.

760
00:49:11,348 --> 00:49:15,296
We are still in a period
of evolutionary transition.

761
00:49:15,352 --> 00:49:19,767
Sexual urges are still present,
yet sex is no longer necessary.

762
00:49:20,223 --> 00:49:23,261
Nature will eventually eradicate
these impulses,

763
00:49:23,327 --> 00:49:26,934
but until then,
until we have become fully evolved,

764
00:49:26,997 --> 00:49:30,376
the Governing Council
needs to ensure that young women

765
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:33,438
don't get caught up
in the futility of erotic pleasure.

766
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,752
We're not supposed to talk about it.

767
00:49:38,508 --> 00:49:40,988
We're actually not supposed
to even know about it.

768
00:49:41,044 --> 00:49:42,955
Especially the old kind of sex.

769
00:49:44,448 --> 00:49:46,428
You know, intercourse?

770
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:48,986
And now there's all this worry about urges.

771
00:49:49,052 --> 00:49:52,522
"Are you having urges?
Don't give in to the urges."

772
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:55,158
Next they'll be telling us
that if we get an itch,

773
00:49:55,225 --> 00:49:56,670
we shouldn't scratch it.

774
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:59,537
It's not physical, it's psychological.

775
00:49:59,596 --> 00:50:01,701
So you just need to not think about it.

776
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:06,403
I mean, if you were to have
those feelings... Thoughts.

777
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:08,848
They're thoughts, not feelings.

778
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:12,577
Which I've never had.

779
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:16,055
We are not trying to discourage intimacy.

780
00:50:16,113 --> 00:50:18,616
At least not emotional intimacy.

781
00:50:19,249 --> 00:50:22,196
It is critical that young people be taught

782
00:50:22,252 --> 00:50:27,326
to nurture meaningful and deeply fulfilling
non-sexual bonds,

783
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:30,600
because they need to
grow up believing in love.

784
00:50:31,962 --> 00:50:34,203
We all need to believe in that.

785
00:50:34,598 --> 00:50:37,909
<i>(LAUGHS You're a funny little thing,
aren't you?</i>

786
00:50:37,968 --> 00:50:39,879
<i>Would you like me to tell you another story?</i>

787
00:50:41,405 --> 00:50:42,406
<i>All right.</i>

788
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:45,578
<i>Well, once upon a time,
there was a fair maiden...</i>

789
00:50:45,642 --> 00:50:46,746
<i>Hello.</i>

790
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:48,414
<i>Oh, Your Highness.</i>

791
00:50:48,478 --> 00:50:50,583
<i>- Oh, I'm sorry.
- It's all right.</i>

792
00:50:50,647 --> 00:50:54,185
<i>- I certainly didn't mean to startle...
- I just wasn't expecting...</i>

793
00:50:54,251 --> 00:50:55,594
<i>- You.
-You.</i>

794
00:50:57,487 --> 00:51:01,526
Jasmine and I, my best friend,
we've talked about it.

795
00:51:01,591 --> 00:51:06,404
And we both like a lot of the same music
and we get along really well.

796
00:51:06,496 --> 00:51:10,900
But I'm just not sure I want
to spend the rest of my life with her.

797
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:11,242


798
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:16,679
We've <i>known</i> each other forever.

799
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,084
<i>- Not quite.
- Well, since high school.</i>

800
00:51:19,142 --> 00:51:20,815
Grade 11.

801
00:51:20,877 --> 00:51:22,788
<i>TERRA". Ah, that's when I had Dahlia.</i>

802
00:51:22,846 --> 00:51:26,919
I had partnered up with a friend of mine,
but that didn't work out.

803
00:51:26,983 --> 00:51:31,659
Then Iris got called,
and we were both looking to pair off,

804
00:51:31,721 --> 00:51:34,600
so it was just great timing.

805
00:51:34,658 --> 00:51:37,298
And we've been together ever since.

806
00:51:38,361 --> 00:51:40,773
I think it's proof that
you can partner with someone

807
00:51:40,831 --> 00:51:44,040
without there having to be that intimacy.

808
00:51:44,835 --> 00:51:47,679
Because you can't force
someone to feel that way.

809
00:51:47,737 --> 00:51:51,947
Terra and I are good friends, we're partners,

810
00:51:52,542 --> 00:51:56,991
we're raising our kids together,
but it's not anything more than that.

811
00:51:57,714 --> 00:52:00,957
I think it's worked out really well for us.

812
00:52:01,017 --> 00:52:02,428
Right?

813
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:06,291
Yes, yeah, of course. It's been great.

814
00:52:07,591 --> 00:52:11,801
But you know, I also think
it's easy to understand,

815
00:52:12,195 --> 00:52:15,870
given the circumstances,
why someone else might want a...

816
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:19,508
I don't know, a deeper bond
with their partner.

817
00:52:20,737 --> 00:52:23,343
I'm not saying it should be sexual
or anything like that.

818
00:52:23,406 --> 00:52:25,147
Of course not, it shouldn't be.

819
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:30,590
But that doesn't mean it can't be
something more meaningful or intense.

820
00:52:31,915 --> 00:52:34,555
But there are men still out there.

821
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:38,159
Some of them aren't
that much older than you or I.

822
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:41,200
So it's not completely hopeless.

823
00:52:43,293 --> 00:52:45,864
It just bothers me
the way that people talk about men

824
00:52:45,929 --> 00:52:47,203
like they're already gone.

825
00:52:47,264 --> 00:52:48,743
They're not.

826
00:52:48,798 --> 00:52:50,539
They're still here.

827
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:53,148
One of them is, anyway.

828
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:58,179
She's talking about Andrew.

829
00:52:59,409 --> 00:53:01,480
Okay, yeah.

830
00:53:02,279 --> 00:53:04,350
Andrew is a good example.

831
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:08,095
And I'll admit it, I'm very fond of him.

832
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:18,637
Can we, uh...
Could we just take a small break?

833
00:53:18,895 --> 00:53:21,876
I just need to... Excuse me.

834
00:53:37,647 --> 00:53:40,992
<i>It's not like I didn't know there was
something going on between them.</i>

835
00:53:42,852 --> 00:53:46,823
<i>The way they look at each other,
and Iris' paintings.</i>

836
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:52,133
But I assumed... I hoped

837
00:53:54,097 --> 00:53:56,236
it was a harmless flirtation.

838
00:53:57,667 --> 00:53:59,146
But it's not.

839
00:54:00,537 --> 00:54:03,541
I can see that now,
it's obvious, they're intimate.

840
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:13,320
<i>It's not like we were planning
for it to happen.</i>

841
00:54:15,385 --> 00:54:19,197
The more time he and I spent together,
we just...

842
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:20,667
It happened.

843
00:54:24,294 --> 00:54:28,037
Everything's gonna change now
with Terra and I,

844
00:54:30,834 --> 00:54:32,643
and Andrew.

845
00:54:42,045 --> 00:54:45,288
<i>She likes having
this aura of mystery.</i>

846
00:54:48,151 --> 00:54:52,224
It's part of being an artist, right?
Being provocative.

847
00:54:54,724 --> 00:54:57,637
But I never believed
she was actually crooked.

848
00:54:59,062 --> 00:55:01,167
I just thought it was an act.

849
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:06,078
<i>Surprise, surprise, right?</i>

850
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:08,116
<i>You only see what you want to see.</i>

851
00:55:08,171 --> 00:55:09,980
- I have no idea what to do.
-it's going to be fine.

852
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,178
No, I don't think it is.

853
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:12,743
- You sure?
-Yes.

854
00:55:18,114 --> 00:55:19,991
What are they doing?

855
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:40,042
What's going on?

856
00:55:41,271 --> 00:55:46,414
Okay, okay, back in the house. Now.
Everyone, come on, go, go.

857
00:55:52,782 --> 00:55:55,023
Can you turn it off, please?

858
00:55:55,985 --> 00:55:57,396
Excuse me?

859
00:55:58,922 --> 00:56:00,492
Now, please.

860
00:56:02,759 --> 00:56:05,035
Of course there are
still women who are attracted to men

861
00:56:05,095 --> 00:56:06,768
and don't want them to perish.

862
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:08,308
We understand that.

863
00:56:09,399 --> 00:56:12,903
<i>But they are a small segment
of the population,</i>

864
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:14,949
<i>maybe 10%.</i>

865
00:56:16,339 --> 00:56:20,048
<i>And like the men they're pining for,
they're a dying breed.</i>

866
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:26,584
Which is why we think it's best
for the population as a whole,

867
00:56:26,649 --> 00:56:30,961
and for young people especially,
to prohibit opposite sex unions

868
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:35,093
and to encourage all the remaining men
to go into the sanctuaries,

869
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:38,831
so we can focus on
the next stage of our evolution

870
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:42,342
without any unnecessary
distractions or confusion.

871
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:51,010
So, this is it right here.

872
00:56:53,176 --> 00:56:57,488
People are always expecting
a big electrified fence or something,

873
00:56:57,547 --> 00:57:00,824
but you have to keep in mind
that this particular sanctuary

874
00:57:00,884 --> 00:57:05,299
is over 300 square kilometers,
and it's one of the smaller ones.

875
00:57:05,355 --> 00:57:08,165
So a fence just isn't an option.

876
00:57:09,125 --> 00:57:11,765
Of course, the service roads are all gated.

877
00:57:11,828 --> 00:57:14,365
We patrol the entire perimeter.

878
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:15,501
But to be honest,

879
00:57:15,565 --> 00:57:18,375
we don't really get many men
trying to escape anymore.

880
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:21,678
That was more of an issue 10, 20 years ago.

881
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:24,149
<i>Hurry!</i>

882
00:57:24,207 --> 00:57:26,847
<i>Back then, they were
wandering out all the time.</i>

883
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:29,151
- Are you getting <i>him?</i>
- Yeah.

884
00:57:29,212 --> 00:57:31,886
<i>SANCTUARY GUARD".
Mostly looking for female contact.</i>

885
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:35,054
<i>Mom! There's a man outside!</i>

886
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:38,621
<i>Just get out of here!</i>

887
00:57:38,688 --> 00:57:40,497
- Hey, no. It's okay.
- Shoo!

888
00:57:40,557 --> 00:57:41,968
<i>It's okay.</i>

889
00:57:42,025 --> 00:57:44,801
<i>- Get inside the house right now.
-it's okay.</i>

890
00:57:44,861 --> 00:57:46,738
<i>Don't come any closer.</i>

891
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:49,640
<i>It's okay. I just want to talk.</i>

892
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:53,203
<i>What's your name? I'm Kirk.</i>

893
00:57:53,269 --> 00:57:55,476
<i>I already called the police.</i>

894
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:58,217
<i>You're very pretty.</i>

895
00:57:58,575 --> 00:58:00,680
<i>Get inside now!</i>

896
00:58:00,743 --> 00:58:03,019
They just couldn't help
themselves, of course.

897
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:05,150
It's just part of their nature.

898
00:58:05,215 --> 00:58:08,196
<i>Border patrol agents
quickly arrived at the scene</i>

899
00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:11,698
<i>and then surrounded the man
when he climbed up into a tree.</i>

900
00:58:11,754 --> 00:58:14,496
<i>I wasn't doing anything!
Just leave me alone.</i>

901
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:16,869
<i>Not you, you're cute.</i>

902
00:58:16,926 --> 00:58:18,633
<i>After a lengthy standoff,</i>

903
00:58:18,695 --> 00:58:21,301
<i>the agents were forced
to use a tranquilizer gun</i>

904
00:58:21,364 --> 00:58:23,640
<i>to sedate the unruly man.</i>

905
00:58:24,701 --> 00:58:28,376
<i>They then returned him to
the nearby Northbrook Sanctuary,</i>

906
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:31,476
<i>where he is no doubt
rethinking any future plans</i>

907
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:33,543
<i>to venture outside the perimeter.</i>

908
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:34,918
<i>Like animals.</i>

909
00:58:34,978 --> 00:58:36,855
That's how I'd characterize it.

910
00:58:36,913 --> 00:58:40,451
Except when animals are endangered,
everybody's all up in arms.

911
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:43,020
Committees are formed, monies are raised.

912
00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:46,624
Can't do without those
Tasmanian fruit bats, can we?

913
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:48,999
But what do they do when it comes to men?

914
00:58:49,058 --> 00:58:52,870
They take away our livelihoods,
shove us out into the wilderness,

915
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:55,205
erase us from their books and movies.

916
00:58:55,265 --> 00:58:58,940
And just for good measure,
they basically go and castrate us.

917
00:59:00,603 --> 00:59:02,048
I'm not joking.

918
00:59:02,472 --> 00:59:04,713
<i>This is evidence,</i>

919
00:59:05,408 --> 00:59:09,049
<i>undeniable proof that
what we've been suspecting for years</i>

920
00:59:09,112 --> 00:59:10,750
<i>is actually going on.</i>

921
00:59:12,015 --> 00:59:16,862
<i>The report clearly states
that they are lacing our food with estrogen,</i>

922
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:19,033
<i>which is the girly hormone.</i>

923
00:59:19,088 --> 00:59:20,567
<i>Smith claimed the document,</i>

924
00:59:20,623 --> 00:59:23,433
<i>which he says is
an internal government memo,</i>

925
00:59:23,493 --> 00:59:26,406
<i>clearly shows that the Governing Council
has been carrying out</i>

926
00:59:26,462 --> 00:59:29,602
<i>a program intended to, quote,
"kill their boners."</i>

927
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:32,374
<i>A man's sex drive is his life blood.</i>

928
00:59:32,802 --> 00:59:36,249
<i>You take that away from him,
you might as well kill him.</i>

929
00:59:36,706 --> 00:59:40,620
<i>So I am hereto tell you that
we will no longer eat the food.</i>

930
00:59:40,677 --> 00:59:44,250
<i>We are now officially on a hunger strike.</i>

931
00:59:44,314 --> 00:59:46,885
<i>They might be able to strip us of our dignity,</i>

932
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:50,329
<i>but they will never take away our manhood.</i>

933
00:59:50,386 --> 00:59:53,162
The problem was, other than that memo,

934
00:59:53,222 --> 00:59:56,226
which the government claimed was
just a discussion paper,

935
00:59:56,292 --> 00:59:57,600
there was no proof.

936
00:59:58,361 --> 01:00:02,400
<i>They had found a way to put
a synthetic hormone into the food</i>

937
01:00:02,465 --> 01:00:04,809
<i>without there being any way to detect it.</i>

938
01:00:04,901 --> 01:00:07,040
<i>Which just shows, once again,</i>

939
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:11,210
how capable their scientists can be
when they put their minds to something.

940
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:12,344
Thanks, <i>Dawn.</i>

941
01:00:12,408 --> 01:00:13,910
<i>Speaking of things that are short-lived,</i>

942
01:00:13,977 --> 01:00:16,651
<i>the Male Liberation Organization
announced today</i>

943
01:00:16,713 --> 01:00:20,024
<i>they are ending their hunger strike
after only a day and a half.</i>

944
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:22,927
<i>Darius Smith, the group's leader,
would only say</i>

945
01:00:22,986 --> 01:00:25,762
<i>it was due to
"circumstances beyond their control."</i>

946
01:00:25,822 --> 01:00:27,392
What were we supposed to do?

947
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:30,904
When a man gets hungry, he has to eat.

948
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,236
That's just the way it is.

949
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:35,173
Does that mean we failed?

950
01:00:35,231 --> 01:00:36,710
No, not in the least.

951
01:00:36,766 --> 01:00:39,246
Now the world is aware of the lengths

952
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:43,079
that this authoritarian regime
will go to denigrate men.

953
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:45,244
But you're still eating the food.

954
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:47,049
Couldn't you have grown
and prepared your own food?

955
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:50,956
Yes, of course we could have
grown and prepared our own food.

956
01:00:51,014 --> 01:00:54,552
But we've deliberately chosen not to,
out of protest.

957
01:00:54,617 --> 01:00:58,929
Because if we'd refused the tainted food,
the story would have gone away.

958
01:00:58,988 --> 01:01:02,492
People will forget what
their government did to us.

959
01:01:02,558 --> 01:01:05,664
But by continuing to eat it every day,

960
01:01:05,728 --> 01:01:08,334
the world is constantly reminded.

961
01:01:08,398 --> 01:01:11,436
They have to live with it just like we do.

962
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:15,942
I'm not at liberty to go
into many details about that,

963
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:20,044
but I can say that we did add
estrogen to the sanctuary food.

964
01:01:20,109 --> 01:01:22,248
But only until 2008.

965
01:01:22,311 --> 01:01:24,791
At that time, we realized the initiative

966
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:27,760
was no longer necessary
due to the increasing age of the men.

967
01:01:28,985 --> 01:01:31,522
They were losing their sex drives naturally.

968
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:36,098
That's a load of crap.

969
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:39,072
Of course they're still lacing the food.

970
01:01:39,128 --> 01:01:41,904
It's bloody propaganda is what that is.

971
01:01:45,902 --> 01:01:48,405
We're not so old either, you know?

972
01:02:14,664 --> 01:02:17,304
No harm in showing this now, I guess.

973
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:21,111
<i>People assume that because
I was the last one born,</i>

974
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:23,776
<i>that I'm very involved in the cause.</i>

975
01:02:25,675 --> 01:02:29,020
<i>I get approached all the time
by pro-male organizations,</i>

976
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:32,355
the MLO, Man Up, Penis.

977
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:34,918
They all want me to use my notoriety

978
01:02:34,984 --> 01:02:38,830
to help raise awareness,
to lobby the government.

979
01:02:41,057 --> 01:02:42,468
But that's not who I am.

980
01:02:45,628 --> 01:02:47,505
<i>I'm not the activist type.</i>

981
01:02:54,737 --> 01:02:58,981
Believe me, there are others
who are way more effective at <i>that than</i> me.

982
01:03:00,877 --> 01:03:02,584
<i>You know, leaders.</i>

983
01:03:07,083 --> 01:03:08,687
<i>I'm just a guy.</i>

984
01:03:15,091 --> 01:03:16,331
<i>I don't know.</i>

985
01:03:16,692 --> 01:03:18,933
<i>It's hard to see how we can be together now.</i>

986
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:23,235
<i>The government would never sanction it.</i>

987
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:28,612
Being intimate with your employer
doesn't look good on your record.

988
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:35,050
I guess I just got to stay positive.

989
01:04:03,239 --> 01:04:05,378
<i>I'm not gonna say it's a terrible place.</i>

990
01:04:05,608 --> 01:04:08,680
Excuse me, are these lima beans
in the quinoa salad?

991
01:04:08,744 --> 01:04:10,746
- No, they're split peas.
-Oh, yeah?

992
01:04:11,981 --> 01:04:13,085
It's <i>not.</i>

993
01:04:15,151 --> 01:04:16,596
<i>They treat us well.</i>

994
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:24,201
<i>But it doesn't matter
how comfortable a place is,</i>

995
01:04:25,161 --> 01:04:27,198
<i>it can still feel like a prison.</i>

996
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:37,916
<i>They say the trick is to fill your days up
as much as you can.</i>

997
01:04:39,442 --> 01:04:41,547
<i>To try to enjoy yourself.</i>

998
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:46,955
<i>But I can't seem to do that.</i>

999
01:04:49,118 --> 01:04:52,588
<i>My mind is always somewhere</i> else.

1000
01:04:54,423 --> 01:04:56,994
<i>Back at the house with Iris.</i>

1001
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:02,236
That's not what it's like
for most of these guys.

1002
01:05:02,298 --> 01:05:04,335
They've gotten used to it here.

1003
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:05,974
They like it.

1004
01:05:07,036 --> 01:05:10,381
But then again, most of them have no reason
to want to go back.

1005
01:05:12,708 --> 01:05:13,812
I do.

1006
01:05:23,886 --> 01:05:25,559
<i>Oh, that's gorgeous.</i>

1007
01:05:26,389 --> 01:05:28,460
<i>Hold that... That will look wonderful on you.</i>

1008
01:05:28,524 --> 01:05:31,937
<i>Here we have the guest of honor,
the oh, so lovely Olive,</i>

1009
01:05:31,994 --> 01:05:34,838
<i>who, as you can see,
is celebrating her first moon.</i>

1010
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:36,467
<i>'l ay!</i>

1011
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:42,610
<i>I guess on the surface,
things went back to normal.</i>

1012
01:05:42,705 --> 01:05:44,582
<i>How does it feel to be a woman?</i>

1013
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:46,950
Uh, tingly?

1014
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:49,783
<i>But it wasn't the same after Andrew left.</i>

1015
01:05:49,845 --> 01:05:52,951
<i>And here we have the proud mother.</i>

1016
01:05:53,015 --> 01:05:56,462
Terra and I, we just couldn't recover
from what happened.

1017
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:58,356
She felt betrayed.

1018
01:05:58,421 --> 01:06:00,094
<i>Let's get a picture of the two moms.</i>

1019
01:06:00,156 --> 01:06:04,036
<i>And nothing I could say was gonna
make her see things differently.</i>

1020
01:06:04,093 --> 01:06:05,800
<i>Um, Harold, can you move?</i>

1021
01:06:06,195 --> 01:06:07,572
<i>Harold.</i>

1022
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:09,701
<i>- What's that?
-Can you move, please?</i>

1023
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:14,012
<i>And the kids really missed Andrew.</i>

1024
01:06:15,604 --> 01:06:17,208
Especially Dahlia.

1025
01:06:19,241 --> 01:06:22,711
For my part,
I tried to move on with my life,

1026
01:06:23,512 --> 01:06:25,082
but I couldn't.

1027
01:06:25,848 --> 01:06:27,885
I couldn't stop thinking about him.

1028
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:34,327
<i>Oh, baby, talk to me</i>

1029
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:40,129
<i>Oh, please, talk to me, yeah</i>

1030
01:06:45,134 --> 01:06:47,080
What really got to me
was when I stopped

1031
01:06:47,269 --> 01:06:52,150
<i>and thought about how I was
going to be there for the rest of my life.</i>

1032
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:58,759
It was like being on the deck of a ship
that was sinking really slowly.

1033
01:06:59,415 --> 01:07:03,693
And the women have all left on the lifeboats,
but the men are just sitting there.

1034
01:07:07,123 --> 01:07:08,534
<i>Waiting to meet their fate.</i>

1035
01:07:09,992 --> 01:07:12,131
<i>Oh, she just don't want to read me</i>

1036
01:07:12,194 --> 01:07:14,105
<i>That's kind of when it hit home.</i>

1037
01:07:15,831 --> 01:07:19,472
<i>How when I'm gone, we're all gonna be gone.</i>

1038
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:24,184
I knew I couldn't just sit there waiting.

1039
01:07:26,442 --> 01:07:28,752
<i>I had to do something.</i>

1040
01:07:31,747 --> 01:07:33,317
<i>I had to leave.</i>

1041
01:07:40,156 --> 01:07:42,864
<i>They don't make it easy to do that, though.</i>

1042
01:07:42,925 --> 01:07:46,395
<i>I left in the middle of the night
and I ran as fast as I could.</i>

1043
01:07:47,863 --> 01:07:50,139
<i>But it didn't take long before they found me.</i>

1044
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:09,293
He didn't think I was gonna be there.

1045
01:08:09,351 --> 01:08:14,130
I was praying that she was going to be there,
but I had no idea if she got my message.

1046
01:08:15,391 --> 01:08:18,270
He was just staring at me
with this stunned look on his face.

1047
01:08:18,961 --> 01:08:20,133
<i>So I said...</i>

1048
01:08:20,196 --> 01:08:22,642
You just gonna stand there?
Or are we gonna get out of here?

1049
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:40,727
<i>I think that we were so determined
to be together</i>

1050
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:44,424
<i>that we never really stopped
and thought about all the implications.</i>

1051
01:08:45,888 --> 01:08:48,198
<i>They were gonna
be looking for Andrew,</i>

1052
01:08:48,257 --> 01:08:50,203
<i>and we couldn't go into hiding.</i>

1053
01:08:50,593 --> 01:08:52,334
<i>What kind of life is that?</i>

1054
01:08:53,229 --> 01:08:57,109
<i>I mean, we'd already been hiding.
Pretending like we weren't involved.</i>

1055
01:08:58,501 --> 01:09:00,538
<i>This was gonna be a lot harder.</i>

1056
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:05,412
It just seemed so unfair,
because what we wanted

1057
01:09:05,608 --> 01:09:06,882
felt so natural.

1058
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:10,153
To be together, to marry, to have kids.

1059
01:09:11,046 --> 01:09:12,992
And none of it was possible.

1060
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:15,918
But if we wanted things to change,

1061
01:09:17,586 --> 01:09:20,624
we were gonna have to be the ones
to do something about it.

1062
01:09:29,765 --> 01:09:33,440
<i>There's been a surprising
development in the sanctuary escape story</i>

1063
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:35,038
<i>that we told you about last week.</i>

1064
01:09:35,104 --> 01:09:38,677
<i>REPORTER 'l: The 37-year-old Myers
surprised everyone today when he arrived</i>

1065
01:09:38,741 --> 01:09:41,620
<i>at the Jefferson Street Community Hall
to give a press conference.</i>

1066
01:09:41,677 --> 01:09:43,679
<i>Andrew Myers,
the youngest man in the world,</i>

1067
01:09:43,746 --> 01:09:47,523
<i>resurfaced today after escaping
from the Alice Lake Sanctuary.</i>

1068
01:09:48,317 --> 01:09:53,130
<i>At an impromptu press conference,
he and his former employer, Iris Balishev,</i>

1069
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:54,896
<i>made a startling announcement.</i>

1070
01:09:54,957 --> 01:09:58,427
<i>We not only want the right to marry,
we want to have children together.</i>

1071
01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:04,641
<i>Even though heterosexual reproduction
is considered to be impossible,</i>

1072
01:10:05,234 --> 01:10:07,805
<i>it is our hope and our belief</i>

1073
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:10,749
<i>that with the resources
of the Governing Council</i>

1074
01:10:11,006 --> 01:10:15,386
<i>and the support of the scientific community,
that it can become a reality.</i>

1075
01:10:15,945 --> 01:10:18,255
<i>That it should become a reality.</i>

1076
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:22,359
<i>And I realize that I'm biased
because I'm in love with a man,</i>

1077
01:10:22,985 --> 01:10:24,658
<i>but I know I'm not the only one.</i>

1078
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:27,929
<i>Please speak up,
because time is running out.</i>

1079
01:10:29,625 --> 01:10:32,265
<i>Seeing the two of them
together like that,</i>

1080
01:10:32,695 --> 01:10:35,574
<i>so obviously in love,
pleading for recognition,</i>

1081
01:10:35,998 --> 01:10:37,807
it awoke something in people.

1082
01:10:42,204 --> 01:10:43,774
<i>Go ahead, you're on the air.</i>

1083
01:10:43,839 --> 01:10:47,582
I don't care
who knows anymore. I like men.

1084
01:10:47,643 --> 01:10:49,281
I'm not saying
I totally agree with it,

1085
01:10:49,345 --> 01:10:52,326
<i>but you have to admit,
they make a cute couple.</i>

1086
01:10:52,381 --> 01:10:53,826
<i><i>I'll tell you what the answer is. No.</i>

1087
01:10:53,882 --> 01:10:55,418
<i>Just let them die off.</i>

1088
01:10:55,484 --> 01:10:58,021
<i>Come on, are they
really that bad? I don't think so.</i>

1089
01:10:58,087 --> 01:10:59,862
<i>This is a question of morality.</i>

1090
01:10:59,989 --> 01:11:03,801
<i>We can't just stand by and let them vanish
off the face of the Earth.</i>

1091
01:11:03,859 --> 01:11:05,702
<i>That's not what women are about.</i>

1092
01:11:05,794 --> 01:11:08,832
<i>There were more calls today
for the Governing Council</i>

1093
01:11:08,897 --> 01:11:10,103
<i>to take action on painlessness.</i>

1094
01:11:10,165 --> 01:11:13,442
<i>of course, the Governing Council
is aware of the public's reaction.</i>

1095
01:11:13,502 --> 01:11:16,039
<i>And they're taking it very seriously.</i>

1096
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:18,711
That's why they've convened
these emergency meetings,

1097
01:11:18,774 --> 01:11:22,916
<i>to assess the situation
and consider any possible solutions.</i>

1098
01:11:22,978 --> 01:11:25,925
It doesn't matter if we figure out
how to keep men around.

1099
01:11:26,015 --> 01:11:29,827
It's not our place to intervene.
This is an act of nature.

1100
01:11:30,019 --> 01:11:31,259
Praise nature.

1101
01:11:31,387 --> 01:11:33,731
<i>FEMALE CALLER B". I think they should
find a way to start producing men again.</i>

1102
01:11:34,189 --> 01:11:38,194
<i>But not too many. Maybe 100 or 150.</i>

1103
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:39,671
<i>Then see how it goes.</i>

1104
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:58,785
<i>There's been so much attention
focused on us from the press</i>

1105
01:11:58,847 --> 01:12:02,989
<i>that we decided to make it
a really small, private ceremony.</i>

1106
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:05,359
<i>But it was beautiful.</i>

1107
01:12:05,754 --> 01:12:06,789
<i>And legal.</i>

1108
01:12:06,855 --> 01:12:09,267
We even have a license to prove it.

1109
01:12:09,958 --> 01:12:12,905
I don't have it on me right now,
but it's the real thing.

1110
01:12:13,562 --> 01:12:15,064
We're married.

1111
01:12:15,831 --> 01:12:17,811
And now we've been getting
even more attention

1112
01:12:17,866 --> 01:12:19,777
because of this little development.

1113
01:12:21,303 --> 01:12:24,011
It's not so little anymore.

1114
01:12:24,073 --> 01:12:27,543
We don't know if it's a boy.
We asked them not to tell us.

1115
01:12:27,609 --> 01:12:29,611
I really want it to be a surprise.

1116
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:33,926
But the procedure worked.
Andrew's DNA is present.

1117
01:12:34,616 --> 01:12:35,720
It's his.

1118
01:12:36,919 --> 01:12:37,920
It's ours.

1119
01:12:41,924 --> 01:12:43,426
It's what she wanted.

1120
01:12:44,393 --> 01:12:46,373
To be with him and have a baby.

1121
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:48,641
So good for her.

1122
01:12:51,066 --> 01:12:53,273
<i>And if it's a boy like everyone seems to think,</i>

1123
01:12:53,335 --> 01:12:55,042
then that's great for the world, <i>too,</i>
I suppose.

1124
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:00,551
Personally, I couldn't imagine
having something like that

1125
01:13:00,609 --> 01:13:02,020
growing inside of me.

1126
01:13:03,579 --> 01:13:05,115
A male baby.

1127
01:13:09,017 --> 01:13:12,726
<i>It turns out that
the Y chromosome was the culprit after all.</i>

1128
01:13:14,289 --> 01:13:16,997
The government scientists
disguised the Y chromosome

1129
01:13:17,726 --> 01:13:19,433
to look like an X chromosome,

1130
01:13:20,095 --> 01:13:23,008
thereby tricking the egg into accepting it.

1131
01:13:37,513 --> 01:13:40,517
Do I wish people had been this excited
when I got pregnant?

1132
01:13:40,582 --> 01:13:41,822
Of course.

1133
01:13:42,885 --> 01:13:45,161
But it's a good thing that's happened.

1134
01:13:45,788 --> 01:13:48,826
I never really liked the idea
of men going extinct.

1135
01:13:49,758 --> 01:13:51,237
Didn't feel right.

1136
01:13:51,293 --> 01:13:54,433
On the other hand, I'm not going to deny

1137
01:13:54,496 --> 01:13:57,670
that I'm happy
they came as close as they did.

1138
01:13:57,733 --> 01:13:59,804
Gave them one hell of a scare.

1139
01:14:00,402 --> 01:14:02,712
And that's exactly what they needed.

1140
01:14:06,074 --> 01:14:07,212
Patience.

1141
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:10,517
That's what I've been saying all along.

1142
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:15,485
We just had to stay vigilant,
keep our wits about us.

1143
01:14:16,752 --> 01:14:19,926
And sooner or later, we'd get our chance.

1144
01:14:20,956 --> 01:14:22,458
And here we are.

1145
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:26,801
It does feel different.

1146
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:31,972
I don't know if it's just in my head,
but I feel like I'm pregnant for the first time.

1147
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:35,179
Which, I guess in away, I am.

1148
01:14:36,438 --> 01:14:38,679
I don't know, I'm just really excited.

1149
01:14:40,409 --> 01:14:42,685
I'm just praying it's not a girl.

1150
01:14:46,849 --> 01:14:48,829
No, no, l was just...

1151
01:14:59,761 --> 01:15:02,207
<i>She won't talk to me</i>

1152
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:06,772
<i>She won't talk to me</i>

1153
01:15:09,271 --> 01:15:11,877
<i>Well, I know she can see me</i>

1154
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:13,817
<i>She just don't want to read me</i>

1155
01:15:13,876 --> 01:15:16,186
<i>She won't talk to me</i>

1156
01:15:17,379 --> 01:15:20,519
<i>Oh, baby, talk to me</i>

1157
01:15:22,885 --> 01:15:25,559
<i>She won't talk to me</i>

1158
01:15:27,956 --> 01:15:30,402
<i>But I know she can see me</i>

1159
01:15:30,459 --> 01:15:34,874
<i>She just don't want to read me
She won't talk to me</i>

1160
01:16:14,503 --> 01:16:16,710
<i>She won't talk to me</i>

1161
01:16:16,805 --> 01:16:18,944
<i>She won't talk to me</i>

1162
01:16:19,007 --> 01:16:21,385
<i>She won't talk to me</i>

1163
01:16:21,443 --> 01:16:24,083
<i>She won't talk to me</i>

1164
01:16:24,146 --> 01:16:26,319
<i>But I know she can see me</i>

1165
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:28,053
<i>She just don't want to read me</i>

1166
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:30,323
<i>She won't talk to me</i>

1167
01:16:30,385 --> 01:16:33,025
<i>She won't talk to me</i>

1168
01:16:33,088 --> 01:16:35,500
<i>She won't talk to me</i>

00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,170
I've been meaning to talk with you.

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,050
It's terrifying, isn't it?

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,470
The president and I have a simple request.

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,310
Tell us what you see.

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,600
If anything in your environment
strikes you as a bit odd, a bit off,

6
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:21,350
pick up the phone.

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,150
Whether it's a package
or a person that seems out of place,

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,030
we'd love you to let us know.

9
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,780
Because there's a lot of noise
out there these days.

10
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,080
A noisy press that's choosing
to dwell on the past

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,290
instead of what's happening right now.

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,410
My husband and I want to protect you.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,090
In two weeks' time,
you will be heading to the ballot box

14
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,420
to decide what kind of country
you want to live in.

15
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,050
It's a profound choice.

16
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,510
But no matter who wins this election,
we're going to need to work together,

17
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,390
watch out for each other,

18
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,980
and, yes, watch each other,

19
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,350
to keep us all safe and sound.

20
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,690
Tell us what you see.

My name is Claire Underwood,
and I approve this message.

25
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,760
[Doug] They didn't disappoint.
Almost every member, sir.

-[Frank] Almost.
-I have a list of those who did.

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:39,350
My fellow congressmen,
I do not need the <i>Washington Herald</i>

28
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:42,850
to tell me that a scoundrel lives
in the White House.

29
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,650
I can see the Democrats are here.

30
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,860
They're eager to debate.

31
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,690
I say to the gentlemen
on the other side of the aisle...

32
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,490
-thank you.
-[Frank] Go.

33
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,740
[congressman 1] Should we
investigate the president

34
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,450
for crimes committed
while he was vice president?

-[Congress murmuring]
-I say, yes. Let's debate.

all day and all night.

[McCarthy] The gentleman from Georgia

may state the nature
of his parliamentary inquiry.

[congressman 2] Do the rules
of the House not require

42
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,050
the president be formally invited
in order to attend?

43
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,470
[congressman 3] Madam Speaker, if I may...

44
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,560
The Speaker recognizes the gentleman
from South Carolina.

45
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,770
The president is wearing
his congressional pin today

and is thereby welcome
to any and all proceedings.

the president wouldn't have an opinion
on the matter being discussed.

and the United States of America.

00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:41,350
Yes. Well, some things are bigger
than the two of us, Will.

159
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:47,810
[Melissa] <i>I don't want him here!</i>

160
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,610
Calm down, Melissa. Please.

161
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:53,030
It's his fault. He's dead.

162
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,320
-Daddy's dead. He killed him.
-Please.

163
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:57,490
-[knocking on door]
-Give me a minute.

164
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:02,330
-Did you take your medicine?
-Yes. Okay? Yes.

165
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:03,580
Yes!

166
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:10,300
You do. You think about what
you would say on a day like today.

167
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:13,260
If a day like today were to happen.

168
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,590
[sniffles] But you let it pass...

169
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,930
because you know you have
so much more left ahead of you.

170
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,430
[inhales sharply]

171
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:23,680
So much to do together.

172
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:29,270
[sniffles] You think...
You think 40 minutes...

173
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,610
[sniffles]

174
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,900
-If we were late 40 minutes...
-[Claire crying]

175
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,280
Or two, or one...

176
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,490
Or if we went somewhere else to eat...
[inhales deeply]

177
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:40,780
[exhales deeply]

178
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:45,620
But to dwell in the past,
to live in what-ifs...

179
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,170
That wasn't my husband.

180
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:52,500
That wasn't us...

181
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,670
-Honey...
-Please.

182
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,720
Okay. Come on.

183
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,930
[sniffles]

184
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,020
I need to... [exhales]

185
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,480
I wanted to say about my father...

186
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:12,730
[sighs]

187
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:16,990
He was so strong... so brave.

188
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:22,830
My father was taking us to...

189
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,500
My father...

190
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:31,580
-Come on, baby. It's okay.
-My father...

191
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:34,800
You killed my father.
You're the reason he died.

192
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,340
[gasps] Melissa...

193
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,430
[sniffles]

194
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,470
-It's all right, Melissa. We understand.
-[shutters click]

195
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:46,680
[whispers] I hope you die
and she becomes president.

196
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,580
What did the girl say to you?

197
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:16,630
She said she hopes I die
and that you become the president.

198
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:29,270
Mr. Macallan, this is
Deputy Director Michaels from the NSA.

199
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:33,060
I'm literally in your office.
I believe we had a meeting.

200
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,570
[Doug] There's been raids as far up
as New York and down to the panhandle.

201
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:40,610
As of now,

202
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:44,490
Green's focusing in on the border
between Virginia and North Carolina.

203
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,330
Seth has a statement ready
for this afternoon.

204
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,200
No. The best statement is no statement.

205
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:51,290
Besides, I want Claire to be the voice
on this until we're ready.

206
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:52,920
Yes, sir.

207
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:56,670
-Quite a crowd out there.
-Well, we better bring Birch in first.

208
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,960
Yes, sir.

209
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:00,420
-[door opens]
-Congressman Birch.

210
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:03,180
Bob.

211
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:06,430
Well, that was a little bit of history
this morning, wasn't it?

212
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,810
-It certainly was.
-I couldn't see it any other way.

213
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,350
No disagreement from here.

214
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:12,020
Well, you know how the Republicans are.

215
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,560
Anything but a decision.

216
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,400
They mistake complaint for leadership.

217
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,230
Well, instead of a committee
to investigate you,

218
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,360
you got one to discuss your declaration.

219
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,400
All the way to election day.

220
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:24,450
Even if there's only
a handful of Republicans

221
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,490
with the grit and spit to put up a fight,

222
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:27,910
we can control the conversation.

223
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:31,000
Get them talking about anything
but that goddamn article.

224
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,790
All right.
Now, who from our side

225
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,620
-do we need to massage?
-Womack.

226
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:38,000
The declaration caught him off guard.
Had to keep him out of it.

227
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:40,760
It's his constituents
that actually fight the damn thing.

228
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,630
Well, let's call in the honorable
gentleman from Missouri.

229
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,760
-Oh, he's a bourbon man, isn't he?
-[Doug] Yes, he is.

230
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,900
-A stunt. Yes, I'm calling it a stunt.
-[Claire] Charlie, if I may...

231
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,020
Tom, please, what are you implying?

232
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:04,990
This request for a declaration of war
is yet another distraction.

233
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,820
And I've never been prouder
of the president than I am today.

234
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:10,620
I'm not denying what happened
to the Millers. It was a tragedy.

235
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,460
[Claire] No, but you are.
Because denying it is the tragedy.

236
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,080
[inhales] This is a pattern.

237
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,040
Your husband's administration,
Mrs. Underwood,

238
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,630
-continues to operate in the shadows.
-Tom...

239
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:23,630
I understand you believe
in the importance of your article.

240
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,090
And I agreed to come here today
and talk with you about it.

241
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,510
But we're fighting
to keep this country safe.

242
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:36,230
Mrs. Underwood, the White House has
yet to release one piece of information

243
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:40,230
about the attempted capture
of those domestic terrorists.

244
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,860
ICO terrorists, yes.

245
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:46,740
Reports from a few hours ago
are saying North Carolina or Virginia.

246
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,070
But that's all we have.

247
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,580
Well, we are circling in,
we're getting closer.

248
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,200
[stutters] I will tell you,

249
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:56,330
our intelligence community,
they are the real heroes.

250
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:59,420
Charlie, if we could get back to my point,
my sources confirmed--

251
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,750
[Claire] Tom.

252
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,630
Heather Dunbar,
no friend of mine or my husband's,

253
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:07,760
looked into these charges,
and cleared the president.

254
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,930
Cleared? Please.

255
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,100
The White House has not had
a single press briefing

256
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,560
since the <i>Herald</i> ran my article.

257
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,190
You keep saying the White House
isn't speaking about this.

258
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,270
I am sitting right here talking to you.

259
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,570
Not Remy Danton or Jackie Sharp.

260
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,110
Or Lucas Goodwin, either.

261
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:28,200
-[mouthing] What?
-[Rose] Excuse me. Lucas Goodwin, meaning?

262
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,360
I'm saying, me. I'm here.

263
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,200
And I don't know how many more times
we have to go over this.

264
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:39,080
You know, a Tom Hammerschmidt
article used to be

265
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:42,920
the first thing I would look for
when I opened the <i>Washington Herald.</i>

266
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,590
[Marshall] The Underwoods
are no longer campaigning.

267
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,760
-[scoffs]
-[Conway] They can call it what they want.

268
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,840
Well, if you think about
the last few days, what's in the air...

269
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:55,100
It might not be such a bad idea for us
to take it one handshake at a time.

270
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,890
Or call it for what it is.

271
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,350
"Home and abroad."

272
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,770
The president is essentially
asking for permission

273
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:04,400
-to fight a war on our soil.
-We can't push back too hard.

274
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,860
We can't afford to look soft on terror.

275
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,030
[Brockhart] We can't look
the other way, either.

276
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:11,450
You of all people
know where this kind of talk leads.

277
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,330
[Frank on TV] <i>...ICO</i>
<i>and the United States of America.</i>

278
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:17,540
Make sure the committee dealing
with the declaration of war

279
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,210
never gets to a vote.

280
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,590
We're not against war, we're against his.

281
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,300
And I want you to reach out to the Speaker

282
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,960
and find out who she's putting
on that committee.

283
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,550
We need to get back
to the president's crimes.

284
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:34,180
That's the story. It's the only story.

285
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,430
Anything else?

286
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,020
I have my script.

287
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,690
[Frank on TV] <i>I will not yield!</i>

288
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,270
<i>I will not...</i>

289
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,620
Harry...

290
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:59,290
I want to know what he says
and when he says it.

291
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,330
Our general isn't used to taking orders.

292
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,670
Will, one more thing.

293
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,750
-What?
-Your wife.

294
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,880
Okay, I know we opened up this campaign
on Pollyhop,

295
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:14,720
but it might be time to close it down...
or at least be more careful.

296
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,640
Well, what did they find out?

297
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,180
The home of the mother of the terrorist,
you know, the one they're looking for,

298
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,980
was vandalized last night.

299
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,310
Garage set on fire. Broken windows.

300
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,480
And, uh, Hannah...

301
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:31,110
well... she posted.

302
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:33,280
She was defending the mother online.

303
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,580
-When?
-This afternoon.

304
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,250
The timing is not good on this.

305
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,290
-I can show you.
-Not now.

306
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:46,670
[scattered applause]

307
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:49,880
[Brockhart] Thank you.

308
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,630
Governor Conway and I are honored
to be here

309
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,840
with the Miller family
and their closest friends.

310
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:59,760
I know the VFW was a big part
of Jim's life here in Knoxville.

311
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,560
With the help of Homeland and our hotline,

312
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,650
we think that Masterson has crossed
into the southwest corner of Virginia.

313
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:07,560
Scott or Washington.

314
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,110
-[Doug] And?
-And...

315
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,030
Assistant Director Green?

316
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:18,450
We're relying on aerial support,
sightings and local law enforcement.

317
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:19,580
But we're fairly confident

318
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,990
we can have him pinned down
in the next 24 hours.

319
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,460
The president wants us to be
absolutely sure.

320
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:28,080
We can't have him getting away again.
Careers are at stake.

321
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:32,380
Everyone around this table is fully aware
of the gravity of the situation.

322
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,590
Good. The president will be happy
to hear that.

323
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:52,000
[Hannah softly] Okay.
What kind of kiss do you want?

324
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,710
-[Charlie whispers] Eskimo.
-In...

325
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,420
and out.

326
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:00,510
I'll be right back.

327
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,650
-You're angry.
-I am.

328
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:17,610
[sighs] I was asked a question
and I answered.

329
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,320
That's the least of it.

330
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,320
Okay, well, I don't want
to talk about it right now.

331
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:26,160
Are you trying to lose this election?
Are you?

332
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,870
Oh, Will, stop it.

333
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:32,580
This woman that you're defending...
Her son just cut someone's head off.

334
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:34,250
And he's still out there somewhere.

335
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,210
-Do you understand what this looks like?
-Stop it.

336
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,340
Do you want to know
why our son can't sleep?

337
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,470
He's eight years old, and he can't sleep.

338
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,140
Because he's having nightmares.

339
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:48,770
Because he thinks there's a big black dog
running around the hotel.

340
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,100
-Dog?
-Yes.

341
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,980
He closes his eyes,
and he can hear it growling.

342
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,020
He's scared, Will.

343
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:04,820
I said what I said
because that woman is a victim.

344
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,280
We all are.

345
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,750
And it has to stop.

346
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,790
I want you to win.

347
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,670
Get yourself a drink. I'll be right back.

348
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,270
[sighs]

349
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:41,110
[LeAnn] That's the mother.
And this is Hannah's response.

350
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:45,610
<i>She's not a criminal and should not</i>
<i>be punished for the sins of her son.</i>

351
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,530
<i>We all, I know, reject the rhetoric</i>

352
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:51,950
<i>and actions of these damaged,</i>
<i>troubled young men.</i>

353
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:55,120
<i>What I mean is,</i>
<i>this is a time for reflection,</i>

354
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:56,210
<i>not aggression...</i>

355
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:59,210
So she's not condoning it,
but it is sympathetic.

356
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,960
Plays into the idea
that Joshua and Zachary

357
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:03,420
were just a pair of troubled kids
looking for a cause,

358
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:05,720
no different than some school shooter.

359
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,260
The post has been shared
over 100,000 times.

360
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,560
I want to talk with her.

361
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,600
-Hannah?
-The mother.

362
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:19,520
[inhales] We've been very careful
about where you appear.

363
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:22,900
-LeAnn, will you excuse us for a moment?
-Of course.

364
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,450
[door opens]

365
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,660
-[door closes]
-We need to dial up the terror.

366
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,460
And the mother can help us with that.

367
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,460
But that also means
we have to locate Masterson.

368
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,340
Soon.

369
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,970
Tom is waiting for me.

370
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,090
Well, you go on.

371
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,190
Francis...

372
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,480
I shouldn't have cried at the funeral.

373
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,280
-No, it played beautifully.
-Not for me.

374
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,660
Come with me.

375
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,120
Come on. Just tell him you'll be late.

376
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,760
-Mr. President.
-It's all right, Officer.

377
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,880
Ma'am.

378
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,090
May I have your scope?

379
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:33,140
Scope on your gun.
I promise I'll give it back.

380
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:40,480
Thank you. Come here.

381
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:55,910
Now, if you just hold the scope
a little a ways from your face...

382
00:24:56,410 --> 00:25:01,210
and look down, straight down,
across the lawn... right to the gate.

383
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,670
-You see them?
-Hmm.

384
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,310
[Frank] Those people want a voice.
Some for, some against.

385
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:18,810
And they're looking back across the lawn,
toward this house and these windows...

386
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,900
and they're thinking,

387
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:25,820
"I wonder what the president
and the First Lady are doing tonight.

388
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:29,200
And will they be able to protect us?"

389
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,820
I should have been there.

390
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:36,490
Where?

391
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:39,960
When you got shot. I wish I was there.

392
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,540
Maybe I could've...

393
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,210
protected you.

394
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:51,260
You see, all those people want...

395
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:56,100
is someone to keep them
from what they're afraid to know.

396
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:04,730
And what are the president and First Lady
doing tonight, Francis?

397
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,980
Well, I believe Thomas is waiting for you.

398
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,030
[officer] Thank you, sir.

399
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:16,200
[Frank] I'll see you in the morning.

400
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,790
[whispers] Do you have a smoke?

401
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,130
[Frank] Thank you.

I've been looking for you.

410
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,840
I got hungry.

411
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,220
So I went down to the main kitchen.

412
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:22,060
That's a lovely group of people
you have down there.

413
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,890
If there's anything you need,
it can be brought up.

414
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:28,310
I didn't know what I needed
until I was eating it.

415
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,320
I heard the president's declaration.

416
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:33,690
Very compelling.

417
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,280
What did you really think?

418
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:43,200
It was almost like the real thing.

419
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:04,810
[sighs] The NSA has good people.
Very good.

420
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:07,190
-Too good.
-Not as good as you.

421
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,980
Good enough to find my algorithms.

422
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:11,360
That doesn't mean they knew
what we were using them for.

423
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,770
No, no.

424
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,070
One second, they send me home,
and then the next,

425
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,950
they tell me, "Come back!"

426
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:20,990
-They'll been watching me. This is a trap.
-Or the only way out.

427
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,330
God damn it.

428
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,370
-You want out?
-Don't you?

429
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,670
LeAnn...

430
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,920
we have done some illegal things here.

431
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,510
There are other campaigns.

432
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:39,720
-If you can get into the NSA...
-That's not possible.

433
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,890
...into their system, you can fix this.

434
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,640
-You're not listening to me.
-I am.

435
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:47,060
I know the Underwoods.

436
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:51,520
The only way
that we are gonna survive this...

437
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:52,860
is if they win.

438
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,990
-You can help them win.
-[sighs]

439
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:59,240
I know you can.

440
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,340
I got on the paper
right around the time you left.

441
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,760
[Tom] Did you start in Style?

442
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,130
Metro desk.

443
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:20,430
But then I did this piece,
a street fashion,

444
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:21,930
kids on the street thing.

445
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,600
-I'm surprised you asked for me.
-[inhales deeply]

446
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,520
Some people are being moved around
and off the team.

447
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:34,150
The Masterson story.
"War, what is it good for?"

448
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:36,440
[chuckles]

449
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:41,280
Were you ever interested
in investigative journalism?

450
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,820
If you ask me, if it's not investigating,
it's not journalism.

451
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:51,160
Word around here is
you can get anybody to talk to you.

452
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:56,380
After 8:00, with a drink in their hands...

453
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,460
yeah.

454
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,680
[inhales deeply]

455
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:09,980
She's the one they say you called a...

456
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:12,980
you know.

457
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:18,270
I'm sorry. I'm a little nervous.

458
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:22,360
[stutters] You're sort of a legend and...
articles on the president?

459
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,200
It'd be an honor to work with you
in any capacity.

460
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:29,450
To be part of this.

461
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:36,340
Did you find him? Did you?

462
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,380
It'll only be another moment.

463
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,760
Because I've done all I can.

464
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,470
Everything you told me to. You know that.

465
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,050
They know that, don't they?

466
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:50,770
Mrs. Underwood.

467
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:55,900
[Claire] I was hoping
to speak to Ms. Masterson.

468
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,070
Just the two of us.

469
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:02,900
[whispers inaudibly]

470
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,550
Is there a problem?

471
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:24,930
It is a bit extreme.

472
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:29,050
Expanding the no-fly list to this extent.

473
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:33,390
The restrictions on visas alone is
unprecedented. How do we justify?

474
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,940
The White House counsel's
been all through that.

475
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,560
It's there in black and white.

476
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:38,940
We're virtually closing down our borders

477
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,780
-without any hard evidence to back it up.
-It's coming.

478
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:45,030
A lot of innocent people
are trying to get into this country.

479
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,860
They could be hurt by this.

480
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:53,830
A change in policy this big,
I want it done right.

481
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:57,080
[inhales] I want you to let the world know

482
00:31:57,170 --> 00:32:00,500
that if they want to continue
coming to this country for our hospitals,

483
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:04,510
our colleges, our golf courses
and God knows what else...

484
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:09,050
they're going to have to deliver more than
my head on the end of a burning stick.

485
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:14,220
Now look, Cathy, I know you have
well-earned relationships out there.

486
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,390
Long-standing.

487
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,060
I'm not holding back, Francis.
I have reached out.

488
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:21,610
Then I need you to reach further.
I want actionable intelligence.

489
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,780
I want to know where ICO is,
or at the very least,

490
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,860
that everyone's out there looking.

491
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,320
Are we clear?

492
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,400
We're clear.

493
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:30,570
Thank you, Cathy.
I know you won't let me down.

494
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:41,630
He's dead.

495
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:45,340
-Is that why you're here?
-We're still looking for him--

496
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:48,760
Because if he's dead, I want to see him.
To touch him.

497
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,140
I'm trying to help...

498
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,520
-Ms. Masterson, please.
-...but he hasn't contacted me.

499
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,140
-[stutters] I wish he would.
-I understand. Calm down.

500
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,020
[sighs]

501
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,150
He's not a monster like they all say.

502
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:07,780
I lost him somewhere.
But he's not... [inhales]

503
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:12,740
But still, monsters do exist, don't they?

504
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,540
I want my lawyer.

505
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:22,830
What for?

506
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:29,130
I'm sorry, I don't know why I said that.

507
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,720
[chuckles nervously]
I don't know why I say anything anymore.

508
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:38,600
I wanted to see you...
to ask you a simple question.

509
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:43,020
Didn't you know
what was going on in your home?

510
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,940
-Excuse me?
-You knew...

511
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:49,070
even before he went to Pakistan.

512
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:51,700
-I mean, you raised him.
-No.

513
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:56,080
No. He had some problems. He got lost.

514
00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:00,330
-But no, nothing like this.
-But you saw what he did, didn't you?

515
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:06,380
-No.
-Would you like to see it?

516
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:09,090
We can show it to you, if you like.

517
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:10,840
No. Please don't.

518
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:15,760
[inhales deeply]

519
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:22,140
What he did to that family, to that man...

520
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:26,360
What sort of person would do such a thing?

521
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:30,860
[crying] He's my son.

522
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:34,410
[sniffling]

523
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:36,370
[sobbing] Oh, God.

524
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,750
I know. It's awful, isn't it?

525
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:44,460
[breathing shakily] Thank you.

526
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,550
When you leave today,

527
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:57,510
there will be some reporters,
some cameramen out there.

528
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,930
But you don't need to say very much.

529
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:05,230
You just need to ask Josh
to turn himself in.

530
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:13,110
There are so many hardworking mothers
and fathers out there.

531
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:15,240
This could've happened to any of them.

532
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:19,700
We are close to capturing
your son, Ms. Masterson,

533
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:22,450
and I will do my best to have you see him.

534
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,660
[breathing shakily]

535
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:26,120
I want to go.

536
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,670
No one's keeping you.

537
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,470
But who did she put in?
Who did the Speaker put on the committee?

538
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,430
Mostly lifers, with secure seats.

539
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:41,770
We're two weeks out.
It's hard to say no to war.

540
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:43,020
[breathes deeply]

541
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:46,440
You and I have some things in common.

542
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:50,980
-We both dislike the president.
-No. I'm still a Democrat.

543
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:53,070
[chuckles] Who leans to the right.

544
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:55,950
Alex, you do actually lean
a little to the right.

545
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,700
Look, he's the commander in chief.

546
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,830
He's got all the authority he needs
to fight them where they are.

547
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:03,490
Well, there's one here.
Out there, right now, as we speak.

548
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,710
Well, I'm a big fan
of American law enforcement.

549
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:07,920
They'll find him soon enough.

550
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,710
We can't just let Francis Underwood
turn us into a nation

551
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:13,420
that's always looking over their shoulder.

552
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:17,800
If you can get yourself
onto that committee,

553
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:21,640
I got a feeling the Chair will give you
all the time you need.

554
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:26,560
My driver will take you back to your car.
But, Congressman...

555
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:29,520
this is your chance.

556
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,320
And I think you know it.

557
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:34,940
[crowd cheering]

558
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,540
Thank you so much for coming out here.
Thank you so much for coming out.

559
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:51,250
-Great to see you. Thanks for coming out.

[Roseanne] Just go away!

562
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:10,480
You have no idea
what is happening in your own homes.

563
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,360
[reporter] Have you any idea where he is,
Mrs. Masterson?

564
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:16,570
Josh, please...

565
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:21,030
please, please turn yourself in.

566
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,330
-This has all got to stop. No, no.

he was waiting for it.

Mrs. Underwood!

583
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:38,060
Does the administration believe
that the explosion was connected

584
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:41,560
-with Joshua Masterson somehow?
-We're not sure yet.

585
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:44,280
Uh, there is strong evidence to suggest.

586
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,650
The owner of the establishment
was foreign-born.

587
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:49,280
Any connection to ICO overseas?

588
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:53,830
I think our Deputy Director Clark here
is better equipped to answer that.

589
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:57,080
We're looking into it.
In the meantime, we've set up a hotline.

590
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,790
-If anyone in the community has any--
-And if the Republican candidate

591
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:02,090
and the rest of his party
refuse to acknowledge

592
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:04,960
the seriousness of the threat
made here at home...

593
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:06,630
know that we will.

594
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:11,260
The FBI is currently gathering
a list of words and images.

She's all right.

And what else? Spit it out, Doug.
It won't taste so bad.

602
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,670
Sir, I know you disagree with me on this.

603
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:43,000
But Director Green and his team
have a location

604
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,540
for the takedown and they're ready to act.

605
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:46,460
And they're positive
it's the right location?

-Adamant.
-When?

Hours.

608
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,430
We can coordinate
out of the Situation Room.

609
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:57,390
Oh, no. I'm gonna meet him in person.

610
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,890
Sir, I strongly advise against that.

611
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:02,770
Duly noted, but I'll be on-site.

612
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,770
Yes, sir.

Could've been worse.

Some found its way behind your ear.

00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:39,100
-Should I be afraid?
-Don't be smart.

00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,180
I should, shouldn't I?

622
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,770
I stole something from you.

What?

624
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,400
What it is, doesn't matter.

625
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,990
I just wanted something that was yours.

626
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:55,740
Well, put it back.

627
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:01,330
Waterfalls.

628
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:05,500
The NSA marked their zero-day exploits
as waterfalls.

629
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:07,460
What can they get us into?

630
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:11,920
We can backdoor
into some very popular social media.

631
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:15,720
I can insert anything your imagination
can think of into those sites.

632
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,010
<i>Underwoods or otherwise.</i>

633
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:22,100
[reporter on laptop] <i>...reports coming in</i>
<i>from a variety of sources</i>

634
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:24,850
<i>stating that local police enforcement</i>
<i>and FBI agents</i>

635
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:26,560
<i>are currently on the ground.</i>

636
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:28,690
<i>We're receiving reports</i>

637
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:30,530
<i>of police activity on the Virginia border.</i>

638
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:32,320
<i>We cannot confirm at this time,</i>

639
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,950
<i>but we believe this is connected</i>
<i>to the manhunt</i>

640
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:37,120
<i>for domestic terrorist Joshua Masterson.</i>

641
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:57,220
The capture of Joshua Masterson
may be close at hand.

642
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:01,310
The FBI is still not commenting,
but if you look at this aerial view,

643
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:04,930
you can see heavily-armed men
making their way through this wooded area.

644
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:31,880
[indistinct radio chatter]

645
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:39,550
[FBI agent] Sir, he's not here.

646
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:44,390
All we have are some loose
domestic connections.

647
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:47,730
A perverse idolization of ICO overseas.

648
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:51,310
He refuses to confirm
any wide-ranging homegrown network.

649
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:56,110
Our interrogators are confident
the asset is no longer valuable.

650
00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:59,070
And risk to reward no longer tenable.

651
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:04,370
Sir, we have reached a breaking point.

652
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:12,340
Did you think I didn't already have him?

653
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:14,800
That I would have left him
out there somewhere?

654
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:17,720
And I thought you knew me.

655
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,080
Josh.

656
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:54,880
Joshua.

657
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,310
Do you want to live?

658
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:15,690
Tell us what we want.

659
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:20,190
Tell us what we want to hear.

660
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:25,070
You're no martyr, are you?

661
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:27,660
[scoffs] Look at you.

662
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:30,910
No, you're not a martyr.

663
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:37,420
No one will remember what you've done,
either here on Earth or in your heaven.

664
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:44,970
[sighs]

665
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,970
So why did you pick the Millers?

666
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,180
Why?

667
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:54,770
What did you see?

668
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:00,740
[softly] Was it the girl?

669
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:05,660
Did you see her first?

670
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:09,280
What did you see?

671
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,080
Or did she see you first?

672
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:20,800
Yeah, that's it, isn't it?
She saw you.

673
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:26,720
-She looked right through you, didn't she?
-[breathing heavily]

674
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:31,600
I don't need to see this person anymore.

675
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:35,350
-Get rid of the asset.
-[Green] Sir.

676
00:47:37,310 --> 00:47:40,110
He's an animal,
but he's still an American citizen.

677
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:44,360
[Frank] We are at war.
And he is an enemy combatant.

678
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:48,200
And he lost whatever rights
he might have had as an American

679
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:51,120
when he cut that poor man's head off.

680
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,290
So don't give me
your pride or your position.

681
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:56,580
Because none of this would have happened

682
00:47:56,670 --> 00:47:59,170
if you'd done what you were told
in the first place.

683
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,050
I'll take care of it.

684
00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:04,260
Yes, you will,
and you will do so willingly.

685
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:10,350
And I want you to get
some good, usable footage...

686
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:11,930
of his killing.

687
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:15,390
And then destroy everything else.

688
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:37,460
[Frank] <i>We will be releasing footage</i>
<i>of Joshua Masterson's killing.</i>

689
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:40,460
The administration
and the intelligence community

690
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:43,340
were hoping to take him alive.

691
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:44,510
But I would like to commend

692
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:47,300
Assistant Director of Counterterrorism,
Nathan Green.

693
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:48,510
And of course all of the work

694
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:51,470
that Secretary Durant has done
behind the scenes on all of this.

695
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:55,680
The information the investigation
has gathered so far

696
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:58,560
points to Joshua Masterson
and Zachary Hawthorne

697
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:03,900
having strong connections to ICO abroad
and ICO's growing network domestically.

698
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:07,650
And so I would like to say this
to ICO directly.

699
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:12,030
You will not infect the mind
of one more of our young people,

700
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:15,870
because I will not stop until I find you.

701
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:19,160
And I say that
for the grieving Miller family,

702
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:22,590
whom I hope will find some sleep tonight.

703
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:24,670
I also urge Congress

704
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:29,260
to accelerate the process and vote
on my request for a declaration of war.

It's him.

The committee is looking
for Remy Danton and Jackie Sharp.

719

What do either of them have to do
with ICO or the war?

720
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:13,470
The talk up on the Hill is
they're going to invite you

00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:15,640
and the rest of your staff to testify.

722
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:18,850
They're gonna use
the Declaration of War to investigate.

723
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:20,100
That's right.

724
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:25,310
They're gonna use the committee
Frank asked for to investigate him.

-Fuck.
-That's right, Doug.

728
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:41,830
Well, perhaps if you could
just calm down for a moment.

The president called Mrs. Miller.

<i>Leave her alone.</i>

you're feeling a little more up to it.

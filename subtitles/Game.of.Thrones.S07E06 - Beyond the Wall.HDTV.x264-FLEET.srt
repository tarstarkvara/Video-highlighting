4
00:02:25,869 --> 00:02:27,845
- You all right?
- Mm.

5
00:02:28,037 --> 00:02:30,072
Ever been north before?

6
00:02:30,247 --> 00:02:31,798
Never seen snow before.

7
00:02:31,889 --> 00:02:33,509
Beautiful, eh?

8
00:02:33,595 --> 00:02:35,009
I can breathe again.

9
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,286
Down south, the air
smells like pig shit.

10
00:02:37,504 --> 00:02:38,744
You've never been down
south.

11
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,994
- I've been to Winterfell.
- That's the North.

12
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,923
How do you live up here?

13
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,884
How do you keep your
balls from freezing off?

14
00:02:45,938 --> 00:02:48,181
You got to keep moving.
That's the secret.

15
00:02:48,322 --> 00:02:52,173
Walking's good, fighting's
better, fucking's best.

16
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:55,166
There's not a living woman
within a hundred miles of here.

17
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:58,220
We have to make do with
what we've got.

18
00:03:02,658 --> 00:03:05,240
This one is maybe not so smart.

19
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:07,705
Davos says he's a strong fighter.

20
00:03:07,753 --> 00:03:10,728
Good. That's more important
than being smart.

21
00:03:10,954 --> 00:03:14,162
Smart people don't come up
here looking for the dead.

22
00:03:15,314 --> 00:03:18,486
So, you met this Dragon Queen,
huh?

23
00:03:18,684 --> 00:03:19,791
And?

24
00:03:19,923 --> 00:03:22,853
She'll only fight beside
us if I bend the knee.

25
00:03:22,941 --> 00:03:25,056
You spent too much time
with the Free Folk.

26
00:03:25,249 --> 00:03:26,958
Now you don't like kneeling.

27
00:03:29,767 --> 00:03:31,900
Mance Rayder was a brave man.

28
00:03:32,186 --> 00:03:33,783
A proud man.

29
00:03:34,004 --> 00:03:37,353
The King-beyond-the-Wall
never bent the knee.

30
00:03:38,592 --> 00:03:42,259
How many of his people
died for his pride?

31
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:56,681
You still mad at us, boy?

32
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,853
You sold me to a witch.

33
00:03:58,942 --> 00:04:00,358
A priestess.

34
00:04:00,595 --> 00:04:03,048
I'll admit,
it is a subtle distinction.

35
00:04:03,228 --> 00:04:05,978
We're fighting a great war.
Wars cost money.

36
00:04:06,057 --> 00:04:07,767
I wanted to be one of you.

37
00:04:08,005 --> 00:04:10,720
I wanted to join the Brotherhood,
but you sold me off

38
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:12,564
like a slave.

39
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,580
Do you know
what she did to me?

40
00:04:14,724 --> 00:04:16,095
She strapped me down on a bed,

41
00:04:16,158 --> 00:04:18,877
- she stripped me naked...
- Sounds all right so far.

42
00:04:19,018 --> 00:04:21,509
- And put leeches on me.
- Was she naked, too?

43
00:04:21,557 --> 00:04:22,783
She needed your blood.

44
00:04:22,881 --> 00:04:24,345
Yes, thank you.
I know that.

45
00:04:24,501 --> 00:04:27,205
- Could have been worse.
- She wanted to kill me!

46
00:04:27,436 --> 00:04:29,369
They would have killed
me if wasn't for Davos.

47
00:04:29,417 --> 00:04:31,181
But they didn't, did they?

48
00:04:31,298 --> 00:04:33,047
So, what you whinging about?

49
00:04:33,211 --> 00:04:34,517
I'm not whinging.

50
00:04:34,651 --> 00:04:37,166
Your lips are moving and you're
complaining about something.

51
00:04:37,251 --> 00:04:39,166
That's whinging.

52
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,072
This one's been killed six times.

53
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,439
You don't hear him bitching about it.

54
00:04:52,345 --> 00:04:53,762
Good lad.

55
00:04:58,572 --> 00:05:01,377
The first time I went north of
the Wall was with your father.

56
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,056
He was a good man.

57
00:05:03,305 --> 00:05:05,220
He deserved a better son.

58
00:05:06,329 --> 00:05:08,080
Were you with him at the end?

59
00:05:08,238 --> 00:05:10,845
I was a prisoner of the wildlings.

60
00:05:11,251 --> 00:05:13,197
But we avenged him.

61
00:05:13,422 --> 00:05:14,494
I want you to know that.

62
00:05:14,542 --> 00:05:16,908
Every mutineer found justice.

63
00:05:17,492 --> 00:05:19,892
Can't think of a worse
way for him to go.

64
00:05:20,116 --> 00:05:21,615
The Night's Watch was his life.

65
00:05:21,663 --> 00:05:24,275
He would have died to protect
every one of those men.

66
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,728
And they butchered him.

67
00:05:25,799 --> 00:05:27,837
I hate that he died that way.

68
00:05:28,632 --> 00:05:31,244
My father was the most
honorable man I ever met.

69
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:33,908
He was good
all the way through.

70
00:05:34,073 --> 00:05:36,892
And he died
on the executioner's block.

71
00:05:37,892 --> 00:05:40,658
Your father wanted to
execute me, you know?

72
00:05:41,006 --> 00:05:42,546
I heard.

73
00:05:42,727 --> 00:05:44,712
He was in the right, of course.

74
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,830
Didn't make me
hate him any less.

75
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:50,252
- I'm glad he didn't catch you.
- Me, too.

76
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,136
Your father gave me
this sword.

77
00:06:00,418 --> 00:06:03,519
Changed the pommel from
a bear to a wolf...

78
00:06:06,877 --> 00:06:08,503
but it's still Longclaw.

79
00:06:14,363 --> 00:06:16,058
Lord Commander Mormont

80
00:06:16,457 --> 00:06:18,862
thought you'd never
come back to Westeros.

81
00:06:20,363 --> 00:06:22,277
But you are back,

82
00:06:22,738 --> 00:06:26,128
and it's been in your
family for centuries.

83
00:06:26,515 --> 00:06:28,307
It's not right for me to have it.

84
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:33,437
He gave it to you.

85
00:06:34,196 --> 00:06:35,988
I'm not his son.

86
00:06:41,271 --> 00:06:43,438
I brought shame onto my house.

87
00:06:45,049 --> 00:06:47,091
I broke my father's heart.

88
00:06:49,712 --> 00:06:52,402
I forfeited the right
to claim this sword.

89
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:55,988
It's yours.

90
00:06:56,169 --> 00:06:58,294
May it serve you well...

91
00:06:58,811 --> 00:07:00,753
and your children after you.

92
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:27,836
Father used to watch us
from up here.

93
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:30,227
He wouldn't say much.

94
00:07:30,586 --> 00:07:31,719
You probably don't remember.

95
00:07:31,767 --> 00:07:33,767
You were inside knitting all the time.

96
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:36,506
I remember.

97
00:07:38,677 --> 00:07:41,635
One time, the boys were shooting
arrows with Ser Rodrik.

98
00:07:42,657 --> 00:07:44,532
I came out here after,

99
00:07:44,893 --> 00:07:46,899
and Bran had left his bow behind,

100
00:07:47,074 --> 00:07:49,008
just lying on the ground.

101
00:07:49,534 --> 00:07:51,774
Ser Rodrik would have
cuffed him if he saw.

102
00:07:54,285 --> 00:07:56,305
There was one arrow in the target.

103
00:07:57,282 --> 00:08:00,313
There was no one around,
just like now.

104
00:08:00,893 --> 00:08:02,768
No one to stop me.

105
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:05,815
So I started shooting.

106
00:08:06,493 --> 00:08:08,118
And every shot,
I had to go up there

107
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,301
and get my one arrow and walk
back and shoot it again.

108
00:08:12,691 --> 00:08:14,440
I wasn't very good.

109
00:08:16,271 --> 00:08:18,773
Finally, I hit the bull's-eye.

110
00:08:19,036 --> 00:08:21,129
Could have been the
20th shot or the 50th.

111
00:08:21,177 --> 00:08:22,520
I don't remember.

112
00:08:22,654 --> 00:08:26,071
But I hit the bull's-eye,
and I heard this.

113
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:29,447
I looked up,

114
00:08:29,597 --> 00:08:31,160
and he's standing right here,

115
00:08:31,271 --> 00:08:32,938
smiling down at me.

116
00:08:35,388 --> 00:08:38,082
I knew what I was doing
was against the rules.

117
00:08:38,252 --> 00:08:41,988
But he was smiling,
so I knew it wasn't wrong.

118
00:08:42,332 --> 00:08:43,873
The rules were wrong.

119
00:08:45,531 --> 00:08:48,426
I was doing what I was meant
to be doing, and he knew it.

120
00:08:51,293 --> 00:08:53,042
Now he's dead.

121
00:08:54,221 --> 00:08:56,285
Killed by the Lannisters

122
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,067
with your help.

123
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:02,874
What?

124
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:13,981
That's your pretty handwriting.

125
00:09:14,457 --> 00:09:16,289
Septa Mordane used to
crack my knuckles

126
00:09:16,337 --> 00:09:18,087
'cause I couldn't write as well as you.

127
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:23,278
"Robb, I write to you
today with heavy heart.

128
00:09:23,493 --> 00:09:25,481
Our good King Robert is dead,

129
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,410
killed from wounds he
took in a boar hunt."

130
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:28,818
You don't have to read it.
I remember.

131
00:09:28,865 --> 00:09:30,324
"Father has been charged with treason.

132
00:09:30,371 --> 00:09:33,090
He conspired with Robert's brothers
against my beloved Joffrey

133
00:09:33,168 --> 00:09:34,910
and tried to steal his throne.

134
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,715
The Lannisters are treating me well

135
00:09:36,763 --> 00:09:38,528
and providing me with every comfort.

136
00:09:38,624 --> 00:09:40,832
I beg you,
come to King's Landing,

137
00:09:40,911 --> 00:09:42,528
swear fealty to King Joffrey,

138
00:09:42,652 --> 00:09:44,590
and prevent any strife
between the great houses

139
00:09:44,653 --> 00:09:46,340
of Lannister and Stark.

140
00:09:46,535 --> 00:09:48,743
Your faithful sister, Sansa."

141
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:50,729
They forced me to do it.

142
00:09:50,777 --> 00:09:51,777
Did they?

143
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,824
With a knife at your throat?

144
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:55,707
Did they put you on a
rack and stretch you

145
00:09:55,755 --> 00:09:56,896
until your bones started to pop?

146
00:09:56,943 --> 00:09:59,324
You don't know what it was like.
I was a child.

147
00:09:59,372 --> 00:10:02,746
So was I. I would have let them kill
me before I betrayed my family.

148
00:10:02,794 --> 00:10:05,590
They told me it was the
only way to save Father.

149
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:08,180
And you were
stupid enough to believe them.

150
00:10:09,645 --> 00:10:12,853
I remember you standing on that
platform with Joffrey and Cersei

151
00:10:12,901 --> 00:10:14,230
when they dragged Father
to the block.

152
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:16,034
I remember the pretty
dress you were wearing.

153
00:10:16,052 --> 00:10:18,428
I remember the fancy
way you did your hair.

154
00:10:19,612 --> 00:10:20,736
You were there?

155
00:10:20,784 --> 00:10:22,075
I was there.

156
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:25,083
Standing in the crowd
near Baelor's statue.

157
00:10:25,687 --> 00:10:26,864
And what did you do?

158
00:10:26,912 --> 00:10:28,926
Did you come running to the rescue?

159
00:10:29,121 --> 00:10:31,583
Did you fight off the
Lannisters and save Father?

160
00:10:31,655 --> 00:10:34,098
- I wanted to.
- But you didn't, just like me.

161
00:10:34,194 --> 00:10:36,676
I didn't betray him.
I didn't betray Robb.

162
00:10:36,739 --> 00:10:40,406
I didn't betray our entire
family for my beloved Joffrey.

163
00:10:42,637 --> 00:10:45,559
You should be on your
knees, thanking me.

164
00:10:45,707 --> 00:10:48,731
We're standing in Winterfell
again because of me.

165
00:10:49,058 --> 00:10:51,075
You didn't win it back,
Jon didn't win it back.

166
00:10:51,123 --> 00:10:52,950
He lost the Battle of the Bastards.

167
00:10:53,012 --> 00:10:54,678
The Knights of the Vale
won the battle,

168
00:10:54,726 --> 00:10:56,645
and they rode north for me.

169
00:10:56,726 --> 00:10:59,356
While you were off, where?
Traveling the world?

170
00:10:59,612 --> 00:11:02,090
- I was training.
- Training.

171
00:11:02,234 --> 00:11:03,903
Well, while you were training,

172
00:11:03,984 --> 00:11:06,997
I suffered things you
could never imagine.

173
00:11:07,288 --> 00:11:09,912
Oh, I don't know about that.
I can imagine quite a lot.

174
00:11:11,434 --> 00:11:14,215
You never would have
survived what I survived.

175
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:17,106
I guess we'll never know.

176
00:11:20,785 --> 00:11:22,864
What are you going to
do with that letter?

177
00:11:23,993 --> 00:11:25,452
I don't know yet.

178
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,325
Who did you show it to?
Where did you find it?

179
00:11:29,421 --> 00:11:31,145
You're scared, aren't you?

180
00:11:32,012 --> 00:11:33,372
What are you scared of?

181
00:11:33,551 --> 00:11:35,348
You didn't commit any crimes.

182
00:11:35,434 --> 00:11:37,231
- No one's going to hang you.
- Well, Arya...

183
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,372
You're scared I'll show it
to Jon and he'll be angry.

184
00:11:39,453 --> 00:11:42,692
No, that's not Jon.
He'll understand.

185
00:11:42,747 --> 00:11:44,434
You were just a scared little girl,

186
00:11:44,552 --> 00:11:46,645
all alone
with the wicked Lannisters.

187
00:11:46,745 --> 00:11:50,619
Do you know how happy Cersei would
be right now if she saw us fighting?

188
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:52,411
This is exactly what she wants.

189
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:53,580
This is what
she's always wanted...

190
00:11:53,628 --> 00:11:54,678
- to tear us apart.
- You are scared...

191
00:11:54,732 --> 00:11:56,115
- the Northern lords will read it.

192
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:00,024
They wouldn't think
much of Lady Sansa

193
00:12:00,072 --> 00:12:02,168
if they knew how she
did Cersei's bidding.

194
00:12:02,729 --> 00:12:05,402
What would little Lyanna Mormont
say?

195
00:12:05,854 --> 00:12:08,402
She's younger than you
were when you wrote this.

196
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,660
Are you going to say,
"But I was just a child?"

197
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,332
You're angry.

198
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:18,738
Sometimes anger makes people
do unfortunate things.

199
00:12:18,788 --> 00:12:21,413
Sometimes fear makes them
do unfortunate things.

200
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,738
I'll go with anger.

201
00:12:54,489 --> 00:12:56,473
You're the one
they call "the Dog."

202
00:12:56,598 --> 00:12:57,911
Fuck off.

203
00:12:58,395 --> 00:12:59,876
They told me you were mean.

204
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,129
Were you born mean or
you just hate wildings?

205
00:13:02,294 --> 00:13:04,669
I don't give two shits about wildings.

206
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,129
It's gingers I hate.

207
00:13:06,223 --> 00:13:07,848
Gingers are beautiful.

208
00:13:07,972 --> 00:13:11,239
We are kissed by fire,
just like you.

209
00:13:11,328 --> 00:13:13,942
Don't point your fucking finger at me.

210
00:13:18,118 --> 00:13:20,926
Did you trip into the fire
when you were a baby?

211
00:13:21,143 --> 00:13:22,754
I didn't trip, I was pushed.

212
00:13:22,892 --> 00:13:24,629
And ever since,
you've been mean.

213
00:13:24,731 --> 00:13:26,231
Will you fuck off?

214
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:28,145
I don't think you're truly mean.

215
00:13:28,229 --> 00:13:29,770
You have sad eyes.

216
00:13:30,828 --> 00:13:32,604
You want to suck my dick,
is that it?

217
00:13:32,841 --> 00:13:34,674
- Dick?
- Cock.

218
00:13:34,964 --> 00:13:36,963
Ah, dick.

219
00:13:37,292 --> 00:13:38,582
I like it.

220
00:13:38,864 --> 00:13:40,386
I bet you do.

221
00:13:40,516 --> 00:13:42,714
Nope, it's pussy for me.

222
00:13:42,937 --> 00:13:45,479
I have a beauty waiting for
me back at Winterfell.

223
00:13:45,656 --> 00:13:47,456
If I ever get back there.

224
00:13:47,586 --> 00:13:50,214
Yellow hair, blue eyes,

225
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,261
the tallest woman
you've ever seen.

226
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,190
Almost as tall as you.

227
00:13:55,817 --> 00:13:57,893
- Brienne of Tarth.
- You know her?

228
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,229
You're with Brienne of fucking Tarth?

229
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,503
Well, not with her yet.

230
00:14:02,729 --> 00:14:05,948
- But I see the way she looks at me.
- How does she look at you?

231
00:14:06,176 --> 00:14:08,354
Like she wants to carve you
up and eat your liver?

232
00:14:08,784 --> 00:14:10,003
You do know her.

233
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,315
We've met.

234
00:14:11,469 --> 00:14:13,308
I want to make babies with her.

235
00:14:13,415 --> 00:14:16,206
Think of them...
great big monsters.

236
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,808
They'd conquer the world.

237
00:14:17,942 --> 00:14:20,737
How did a mad fucker
like you live this long?

238
00:14:21,113 --> 00:14:22,972
I'm good at killing people.

239
00:14:25,693 --> 00:14:27,222
You don't look much like him.

240
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,409
Who's that?

241
00:14:28,456 --> 00:14:29,964
Your father.

242
00:14:30,826 --> 00:14:32,908
I suppose you favor your mother.

243
00:14:33,151 --> 00:14:34,386
You knew him?

244
00:14:34,892 --> 00:14:36,378
'Course I did.

245
00:14:36,607 --> 00:14:38,143
When he was Hand,

246
00:14:38,292 --> 00:14:39,995
he sent me off hunting for the Mountain.

247
00:14:40,135 --> 00:14:41,593
Your wildling friend told me

248
00:14:41,641 --> 00:14:42,979
the red woman brought you back.

249
00:14:44,066 --> 00:14:47,518
Thoros has brought me
back six times.

250
00:14:48,623 --> 00:14:50,612
We both serve the same lord.

251
00:14:51,096 --> 00:14:52,675
I serve the North.

252
00:14:53,022 --> 00:14:54,776
The North didn't raise
you from the dead.

253
00:14:54,836 --> 00:14:56,440
The Lord of Light never spoke to me.

254
00:14:56,667 --> 00:14:58,011
I don't know anything
about him.

255
00:14:58,089 --> 00:14:59,526
I don't know
what he wants from me.

256
00:14:59,574 --> 00:15:02,448
- He wants you alive.
- Why?

257
00:15:02,672 --> 00:15:04,347
I don't know.

258
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,862
That's all anyone can tell me...
"I don't know."

259
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:10,112
So, what's the point in serving a God

260
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,097
if none of us knows what he wants?

261
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:14,886
I think about that all the time.

262
00:15:15,255 --> 00:15:17,823
I don't think it's our
purpose to understand.

263
00:15:18,134 --> 00:15:21,198
Except one thing...
we're soldiers.

264
00:15:21,574 --> 00:15:24,050
We have to know
what we're fighting for.

265
00:15:24,552 --> 00:15:26,909
I'm not fighting so some
man or woman I barely know

266
00:15:26,957 --> 00:15:29,409
can sit on a throne
made of swords.

267
00:15:30,058 --> 00:15:31,987
So, what are you fighting for?

268
00:15:32,295 --> 00:15:33,695
Life.

269
00:15:34,688 --> 00:15:36,520
Death is the enemy.

270
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:40,011
The first enemy and the last.

271
00:15:41,545 --> 00:15:43,120
But we all die.

272
00:15:44,215 --> 00:15:46,456
The enemy always wins.

273
00:15:46,704 --> 00:15:48,597
And we still need to fight him.

274
00:15:48,745 --> 00:15:50,448
That's all I know.

275
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:53,815
You and I won't find much
joy while we're here,

276
00:15:54,168 --> 00:15:56,089
but we can keep others alive.

277
00:15:56,387 --> 00:15:59,178
We can defend those who
can't defend themselves.

278
00:16:01,946 --> 00:16:04,675
"I am the shield that
guards the realms of men."

279
00:16:04,972 --> 00:16:08,292
Maybe we don't need to
understand any more than that.

280
00:16:08,508 --> 00:16:10,472
Maybe that's enough.

281
00:16:10,616 --> 00:16:11,917
Aye.

282
00:16:13,355 --> 00:16:15,105
Maybe that's enough.

283
00:16:23,175 --> 00:16:25,517
That's what I saw in the fire.

284
00:16:26,216 --> 00:16:28,257
A mountain like an arrowhead.

285
00:16:30,025 --> 00:16:31,442
Are you sure?

286
00:16:34,242 --> 00:16:35,792
We're getting close.

287
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,666
Do you know
what I like about you?

288
00:16:47,246 --> 00:16:49,815
- I honestly don't.
- You're not a hero.

289
00:16:50,314 --> 00:16:51,855
Oh.

290
00:16:52,058 --> 00:16:54,558
Well, I've been heroic on occasion.

291
00:16:54,672 --> 00:16:57,323
I once charged through the Mud
Gate of King's Landing and...

292
00:16:57,371 --> 00:16:58,753
I don't want you to be a hero.

293
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:01,831
Heroes do stupid things
and they die.

294
00:17:02,234 --> 00:17:04,159
Drogo, Jorah, Daario,

295
00:17:04,207 --> 00:17:07,497
even this... Jon Snow...

296
00:17:08,036 --> 00:17:09,667
they all try to outdo each other.

297
00:17:09,867 --> 00:17:12,261
Who can do the stupidest,
bravest thing.

298
00:17:12,518 --> 00:17:14,683
It's interesting,
these heroes you name.

299
00:17:14,731 --> 00:17:16,886
Drogo, Jorah, Daario,

300
00:17:16,934 --> 00:17:19,850
even this... Jon Snow.

301
00:17:20,158 --> 00:17:21,729
They all fell in love with you.

302
00:17:21,892 --> 00:17:24,339
- Jon Snow's not in love with me.
- Oh, my mistake.

303
00:17:24,538 --> 00:17:26,315
I suppose he stares at you
longingly

304
00:17:26,363 --> 00:17:29,280
because he's hopeful for a
successful military alliance.

305
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:34,026
He's too little for me.

306
00:17:35,411 --> 00:17:36,612
I didn't mean...

307
00:17:36,668 --> 00:17:39,018
As heroes go,
he is quite little.

308
00:17:39,363 --> 00:17:41,292
I know you're brave.

309
00:17:41,975 --> 00:17:44,206
I wouldn't have chosen
a coward as my Hand.

310
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:51,448
So, if all goes well,

311
00:17:51,496 --> 00:17:53,550
I'll finally get to meet your sister.

312
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:56,723
From everything you've
told me about her,

313
00:17:56,771 --> 00:17:58,936
she'd rather murder me
than speak with me.

314
00:17:59,065 --> 00:18:02,471
Oh, first, she'd torture
you in some horrible way,

315
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:03,919
then she'd murder you.

316
00:18:05,002 --> 00:18:08,018
Nobody trusts my sister
less than I do, believe me.

317
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:10,104
But if we go to the capital,

318
00:18:10,177 --> 00:18:12,823
we'll go with two armies,
we'll go with three dragons.

319
00:18:12,909 --> 00:18:16,276
Anyone touches you, King's Landing
burns down to the foundation stones.

320
00:18:16,401 --> 00:18:18,441
And right now, she's thinking
of how to set a trap.

321
00:18:18,489 --> 00:18:19,698
Of course she is.

322
00:18:19,746 --> 00:18:21,948
And she's wondering
what trap you're laying for her.

323
00:18:22,098 --> 00:18:23,556
Are we?

324
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,916
Laying any traps?

325
00:18:27,623 --> 00:18:30,689
If we want to create a
new and better world,

326
00:18:30,893 --> 00:18:33,564
I'm not sure deceit and mass
murder is the best way to start.

327
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:36,536
Which war was won without
deceit and mass murder?

328
00:18:37,938 --> 00:18:40,062
Yes, you'll need to be ruthless

329
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,627
if you're going to win the throne.

330
00:18:41,796 --> 00:18:43,720
You need to inspire a degree of fear.

331
00:18:43,893 --> 00:18:45,892
But fear is all Cersei has.

332
00:18:46,057 --> 00:18:48,595
It's all my father had,
and Joffrey.

333
00:18:48,844 --> 00:18:50,541
It makes their power brittle

334
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:53,916
because everyone beneath
them longs to see them dead.

335
00:18:54,348 --> 00:18:56,666
Aegon Targaryen got quite
a long way on fear.

336
00:18:56,756 --> 00:18:58,134
He did.

337
00:18:58,478 --> 00:19:00,720
But you once spoke to me
of breaking the wheel.

338
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,257
Aegon built a wheel.

339
00:19:02,978 --> 00:19:04,697
If that's the kind of
queen you want to be,

340
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:07,134
how are you different from all the
other tyrants that came before you?

341
00:19:07,181 --> 00:19:09,502
So we walk into the lions' den.

342
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,908
My brother promised me
he'd keep a grip

343
00:19:11,956 --> 00:19:13,017
on the Lannister forces.

344
00:19:13,065 --> 00:19:16,689
Forgive me, but I don't care
about any Lannister promises.

345
00:19:17,241 --> 00:19:18,447
Except yours.

346
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,197
And I promised him

347
00:19:20,267 --> 00:19:23,181
I'd keep you from doing
anything impulsive.

348
00:19:24,023 --> 00:19:25,423
Impulsive?

349
00:19:28,705 --> 00:19:31,412
This will be a difficult negotiation.

350
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:34,686
We're sitting down with people who
want to see us both headless.

351
00:19:34,837 --> 00:19:37,085
My sister is likely to say
something provocative.

352
00:19:37,197 --> 00:19:39,631
- And?
- And you have been known

353
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,514
to lose your temper
from time to time,

354
00:19:41,615 --> 00:19:42,858
as all great leaders do.

355
00:19:42,906 --> 00:19:45,046
When have I lost my temper?

356
00:19:46,312 --> 00:19:47,671
Burning the Tarlys, for instance.

357
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:49,260
That was not impulsive.

358
00:19:49,308 --> 00:19:51,546
That was necessary.

359
00:19:51,752 --> 00:19:53,668
- Perhaps.
- Perhaps?

360
00:19:54,567 --> 00:19:57,280
Perhaps the father needed
to die and not the son.

361
00:19:57,338 --> 00:19:59,755
Perhaps they both needed time
to contemplate their mistakes

362
00:19:59,803 --> 00:20:02,055
in the solitude of a cold cell.

363
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:04,335
We had no time to discuss
the possibilities

364
00:20:04,383 --> 00:20:06,163
before you ended
their possibilities.

365
00:20:06,211 --> 00:20:07,898
One could be forgiven for
thinking you're taking

366
00:20:07,945 --> 00:20:09,326
your family's side
in this debate.

367
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,160
I am taking their side.

368
00:20:11,327 --> 00:20:13,035
You need to take your
enemy's side

369
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:14,952
if you're going to see
things the way they do.

370
00:20:15,036 --> 00:20:16,928
And you need to see
things the way they do

371
00:20:17,061 --> 00:20:18,831
if you're going to
anticipate their actions,

372
00:20:18,879 --> 00:20:21,772
respond effectively, and beat them.

373
00:20:22,025 --> 00:20:23,952
Which I want you to do
very much.

374
00:20:24,404 --> 00:20:27,904
Because I believe in you
and in the world you want to build.

375
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,202
But the world you want to build

376
00:20:30,344 --> 00:20:31,678
doesn't get built all at once.

377
00:20:31,726 --> 00:20:34,171
Probably not in a single lifetime.

378
00:20:34,787 --> 00:20:37,467
How do we ensure that
your vision endures?

379
00:20:37,629 --> 00:20:40,588
After you break the wheel,
how do we make sure it stays broken?

380
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,710
You want to know who sits on the
Iron Throne after I'm dead.

381
00:20:45,788 --> 00:20:47,188
Is that it?

382
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,415
You say
you can't have children,

383
00:20:50,807 --> 00:20:53,538
but there are other ways
of choosing a successor.

384
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:55,538
The Night's Watch has one method.

385
00:20:55,675 --> 00:20:57,803
The ironborn, for all their
many flaws, have another.

386
00:20:57,851 --> 00:21:00,366
We will discuss the succession
after I wear the crown.

387
00:21:00,414 --> 00:21:02,163
Your Grace,
I saw hundreds of arrows

388
00:21:02,211 --> 00:21:04,359
fly towards you when you
fought on the Blackwater Rush,

389
00:21:04,406 --> 00:21:06,489
and I saw hundreds of arrows miss.

390
00:21:06,653 --> 00:21:08,803
But any one of them could have
found your heart and ended your...

391
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,681
You've been thinking about my
death quite a bit, haven't you?

392
00:21:12,006 --> 00:21:13,500
Is this one of the items you discussed

393
00:21:13,547 --> 00:21:15,038
with your brother in King's Landing?

394
00:21:15,086 --> 00:21:16,968
I'm trying to serve you by
planning for the long term.

395
00:21:17,015 --> 00:21:18,772
Perhaps if you planned
for the short term,

396
00:21:18,864 --> 00:21:20,905
we wouldn't have lost
Dorne and Highgarden.

397
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:27,889
We will discuss the succession
after I wear the crown.

398
00:22:04,834 --> 00:22:06,234
Look!

399
00:22:14,702 --> 00:22:16,102
A bear.

400
00:22:17,061 --> 00:22:18,728
Big fucker.

401
00:22:25,853 --> 00:22:28,186
Do bears have blue eyes?

402
00:24:27,879 --> 00:24:30,043
We have to get him
back to Eastwatch.

403
00:24:31,754 --> 00:24:33,154
Flask.

404
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,580
Go on.

405
00:25:08,483 --> 00:25:09,732
You all right?

406
00:25:09,851 --> 00:25:12,858
I just got bit by a dead bear.

407
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,913
Aye, you did.

408
00:25:17,944 --> 00:25:19,861
Funny old life.

409
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:22,922
Right, then.

410
00:25:23,149 --> 00:25:25,066
We're off.

411
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:52,663
- Where did she get it?
- I don't know.

412
00:25:52,988 --> 00:25:55,113
She seems very resourceful.

413
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:58,913
You're worried.

414
00:25:59,063 --> 00:26:00,772
We're asking 20,000 men

415
00:26:00,847 --> 00:26:04,116
to fight with us in the worst
winter any of them have ever seen.

416
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:06,882
The weather will be the
least of their problems.

417
00:26:07,262 --> 00:26:09,702
Many of them will be happy to
find a good reason to go home.

418
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:12,897
- You question their loyalty?
- Their loyalty is to Jon.

419
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,382
Jon is not here.
I haven't heard from him in weeks.

420
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:17,397
You're the Lady of Winterfell.

421
00:26:17,502 --> 00:26:20,343
The king chose you to
rule in his absence.

422
00:26:21,762 --> 00:26:23,515
And rule you have.

423
00:26:23,658 --> 00:26:26,733
Wisely, ably.

424
00:26:26,991 --> 00:26:29,022
They see that. They respect you.

425
00:26:29,241 --> 00:26:30,788
Some may even prefer you.

426
00:26:30,836 --> 00:26:32,273
Yes, they turned their backs on Jon

427
00:26:32,321 --> 00:26:34,765
when it was time to retake Winterfell,
then they named him their king,

428
00:26:34,813 --> 00:26:36,814
and now they're ready to turn
their backs on him again.

429
00:26:36,992 --> 00:26:39,046
How far would you
trust men like that?

430
00:26:39,132 --> 00:26:41,085
They're all bloody wind vanes.

431
00:26:41,265 --> 00:26:43,306
If they found out that
I wrote that letter,

432
00:26:43,431 --> 00:26:44,492
a woman who's already married

433
00:26:44,539 --> 00:26:46,772
not one,
but two enemies of her house...

434
00:26:48,012 --> 00:26:50,554
By the time Jon comes back,
he'll have no army left.

435
00:26:50,694 --> 00:26:52,486
Arya's not like them.

436
00:26:54,927 --> 00:26:56,342
She's your sister.

437
00:26:56,968 --> 00:26:58,077
You may have disagreements,

438
00:26:58,125 --> 00:27:00,265
but she would never betray
her family.

439
00:27:00,467 --> 00:27:03,007
She would if she thought
I was going to betray Jon.

440
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,577
Is that what she thinks?

441
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:06,390
I don't know what she thinks.

442
00:27:06,718 --> 00:27:08,760
I don't know her anymore.

443
00:27:10,723 --> 00:27:12,843
Perhaps Lady Brienne could help.

444
00:27:15,356 --> 00:27:19,069
She's sworn to protect both
of Catelyn Stark's girls,

445
00:27:19,175 --> 00:27:20,575
is she not?

446
00:27:21,845 --> 00:27:23,262
She is.

447
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:31,189
And if one of you were planning
to harm the other in any way,

448
00:27:31,385 --> 00:27:33,510
wouldn't she be honor
bound to intercede?

449
00:27:36,239 --> 00:27:37,697
She would.

450
00:27:50,356 --> 00:27:53,480
- Something I've always wanted to know.
- All right.

451
00:27:53,614 --> 00:27:57,301
How drunk were you when you charged
through the breach on Pyke?

452
00:27:57,866 --> 00:28:01,658
If I'm being honest, I don't remember
charging through the breach.

453
00:28:03,027 --> 00:28:05,769
Some of the lads told me
about it the next morning.

454
00:28:06,512 --> 00:28:08,480
Sounded like a good scrap.

455
00:28:08,528 --> 00:28:10,285
Aye.

456
00:28:10,341 --> 00:28:12,902
It was a proper scrap.

457
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:16,324
The ironborn thought you
were some kind of God,

458
00:28:16,556 --> 00:28:19,113
the way you were waving
that flaming sword.

459
00:28:20,015 --> 00:28:23,082
I thought you were the
bravest man I ever saw.

460
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,355
Just the drunkest.

461
00:29:04,523 --> 00:29:05,811
Where's the rest of them?

462
00:29:05,915 --> 00:29:08,166
If we wait long enough,
we'll find out.

463
00:31:32,158 --> 00:31:33,322
Run back to Eastwatch.

464
00:31:33,426 --> 00:31:35,634
Get a raven to Daenerys,
tell her what's happened.

465
00:31:35,682 --> 00:31:39,057
- I'm not leaving you.
- You're the fastest. Go, now.

466
00:31:39,715 --> 00:31:42,127
You're faster without the hammer.
Give it.

467
00:31:42,544 --> 00:31:43,944
Give it!

468
00:31:51,236 --> 00:31:53,752
- Come on!
- Run!

469
00:31:53,908 --> 00:31:55,407
Come on!

470
00:32:01,597 --> 00:32:03,137
Stop!

471
00:32:19,807 --> 00:32:21,207
Go!

472
00:35:01,913 --> 00:35:03,757
What happened?

473
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:05,343
Where are the others?

474
00:35:05,442 --> 00:35:08,390
Raven, we need to send a raven.

475
00:35:08,525 --> 00:35:10,710
Get the maester, now!

476
00:35:49,994 --> 00:35:51,394
Thoros?

477
00:35:54,762 --> 00:35:56,220
Thoros.

478
00:36:13,399 --> 00:36:16,016
They say it's one of
the better ways to go.

479
00:36:28,944 --> 00:36:32,959
Lord of Light, show us the way.

480
00:36:33,401 --> 00:36:36,942
Come to us in our darkness and
lead Your servant into the light.

481
00:36:41,874 --> 00:36:43,832
We have to burn his body.

482
00:36:46,678 --> 00:36:49,060
We'll all be close behind him

483
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:53,123
unless the Lord of Light is kind
enough to send us a bit of fire.

484
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,629
Lord of Light,

485
00:37:03,732 --> 00:37:05,809
come to us in our darkness,

486
00:37:06,394 --> 00:37:09,102
for the night is dark
and full of terrors.

487
00:37:31,996 --> 00:37:33,871
We'll all freeze soon.

488
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:36,707
And so will the water.

489
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,613
When you killed the white walker,

490
00:37:43,112 --> 00:37:46,215
almost all the dead
that followed it fell.

491
00:37:46,641 --> 00:37:48,192
Why?

492
00:37:48,548 --> 00:37:50,798
Maybe he was the one
who turned them.

493
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:53,801
We can go for the walkers.

494
00:37:54,113 --> 00:37:55,705
Maybe we'll stand a chance.

495
00:37:55,753 --> 00:37:56,903
No.

496
00:37:58,124 --> 00:38:00,915
We need to take that
thing back with us.

497
00:38:03,738 --> 00:38:06,196
There's a raven flying
for Dragonstone now.

498
00:38:06,596 --> 00:38:08,848
Daenerys is our only chance.

499
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:12,762
No. There's another.

500
00:38:14,809 --> 00:38:16,209
Kill him.

501
00:38:17,153 --> 00:38:18,934
He turned them all.

502
00:38:23,147 --> 00:38:24,691
You don't understand.

503
00:38:26,014 --> 00:38:27,426
The Lord brought you back.

504
00:38:27,474 --> 00:38:29,293
He brought me back.

505
00:38:29,634 --> 00:38:32,403
No one else. Just us.

506
00:38:32,576 --> 00:38:34,952
Did He do it to watch
us freeze to death?

507
00:38:36,825 --> 00:38:40,032
Careful, Beric.
You lost your priest.

508
00:38:40,345 --> 00:38:41,895
This is your last life.

509
00:38:41,973 --> 00:38:44,715
I've been waiting for the
end for a long time.

510
00:38:45,095 --> 00:38:47,761
Maybe the Lord brought
me here to find it.

511
00:38:47,942 --> 00:38:51,051
Every lord I've ever met's been a cunt.

512
00:38:51,293 --> 00:38:54,168
Don't see why the Lord of Light
should be any different.

513
00:39:06,604 --> 00:39:08,004
My lady.

514
00:39:17,713 --> 00:39:19,629
My lady?

515
00:39:19,834 --> 00:39:23,959
It's an invitation
to King's Landing.

516
00:39:29,547 --> 00:39:31,556
My lady, you are the Lady of Winterfell.

517
00:39:31,604 --> 00:39:33,915
I am, and you will
represent my interests

518
00:39:33,963 --> 00:39:35,845
at this gathering as you see them.

519
00:39:36,287 --> 00:39:39,662
They invited you.
They want you there.

520
00:39:40,216 --> 00:39:42,173
I will not set foot in King's Landing

521
00:39:42,221 --> 00:39:44,704
while Cersei Lannister is queen.

522
00:39:44,802 --> 00:39:46,290
If they want another Stark prisoner,

523
00:39:46,338 --> 00:39:47,907
they can come and take me.

524
00:39:48,092 --> 00:39:50,841
Until then, I'll remain where I belong.

525
00:39:51,193 --> 00:39:53,337
I have work to do here.

526
00:39:55,338 --> 00:39:56,837
It's not safe.

527
00:39:57,187 --> 00:39:58,540
Ser Jaime will be there.

528
00:39:58,748 --> 00:40:00,853
You said he treated
you honorably before.

529
00:40:01,082 --> 00:40:03,017
I'm not worried about me.

530
00:40:03,128 --> 00:40:05,650
It's not safe leaving
you with Littlefinger.

531
00:40:06,232 --> 00:40:08,353
I have many guards who would happily

532
00:40:08,401 --> 00:40:09,689
imprison him or behead him

533
00:40:09,737 --> 00:40:10,861
whether or not you're here.

534
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:12,986
And you trust their loyalty?

535
00:40:13,416 --> 00:40:16,306
You trust he hasn't been speaking
to them all behind your back?

536
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:19,996
Let me at least leave Podrick
behind to watch over you.

537
00:40:20,123 --> 00:40:21,432
He has become
a competent swordsman...

538
00:40:21,479 --> 00:40:25,689
I do not need to be watched
over or minded or cared for.

539
00:40:25,861 --> 00:40:26,907
I'm not a child,

540
00:40:26,955 --> 00:40:29,603
I am the Lady of
Winterfell, and I am home.

541
00:40:29,736 --> 00:40:31,907
This is the safest place for me.

542
00:40:32,872 --> 00:40:34,733
My lady,

543
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:38,757
I swore an oath to protect you and
your sister. If I abandon you...

544
00:40:38,805 --> 00:40:41,218
The trip to King's Landing
is long, Lady Brienne,

545
00:40:41,266 --> 00:40:43,257
and you won't be traveling
on summer roads.

546
00:40:43,552 --> 00:40:46,522
The sooner you leave, the better
your chances of making it on time.

547
00:40:49,661 --> 00:40:51,061
Yes, my lady.

548
00:41:12,703 --> 00:41:13,983
You can't.

549
00:41:14,694 --> 00:41:16,568
The most important person
in the world

550
00:41:16,616 --> 00:41:18,936
can't fly off to the most
dangerous place in the world.

551
00:41:19,244 --> 00:41:21,030
- Who else can?
- No one.

552
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:22,991
They knew the risks
when they left.

553
00:41:23,168 --> 00:41:25,296
You can't win the throne
if you're dead.

554
00:41:25,889 --> 00:41:27,929
You can't break the
wheel if you're dead.

555
00:41:28,646 --> 00:41:30,217
So, what would you have me do?

556
00:41:30,308 --> 00:41:31,671
Nothing.

557
00:41:32,015 --> 00:41:34,804
Sometimes nothing is the
hardest thing to do.

558
00:41:36,012 --> 00:41:39,428
If you die, we're all lost.

559
00:41:40,916 --> 00:41:43,155
Everyone, everything.

560
00:41:44,321 --> 00:41:47,265
You told me to do nothing
before and I listened to you.

561
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:49,530
I'm not doing nothing again.

562
00:42:43,997 --> 00:42:46,122
Dumb cunt.

563
00:43:06,096 --> 00:43:08,533
Oh, fuck.

564
00:43:50,089 --> 00:43:51,631
Fuck it.

565
00:45:10,404 --> 00:45:11,804
Yah!

566
00:45:21,163 --> 00:45:22,563
Yah!

567
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:37,791
Fall back!

568
00:45:38,802 --> 00:45:41,635
- Fall back!
- Come on!

569
00:46:05,323 --> 00:46:07,239
Help me!

570
00:49:01,051 --> 00:49:02,451
Go!

571
00:49:18,476 --> 00:49:19,876
Jon!

572
00:51:06,807 --> 00:51:07,963
Go!

573
00:51:08,011 --> 00:51:10,512
Go now! Leave!

574
00:53:53,699 --> 00:53:55,027
Uncle Benjen!

575
00:53:55,213 --> 00:53:56,613
How?

576
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:01,521
- You ride for the pass.
- Come with me.

577
00:54:01,772 --> 00:54:03,144
There's no time.

578
00:54:03,285 --> 00:54:05,058
Go!

579
00:55:16,155 --> 00:55:18,029
We'll meet again, Clegane.

580
00:55:18,858 --> 00:55:20,506
Fucking hope not.

581
00:55:48,817 --> 00:55:51,024
It's time to go, Your Grace.

582
00:55:52,777 --> 00:55:54,236
A bit longer.

583
00:56:16,701 --> 00:56:18,743
Rider approaching!

584
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:30,622
Open the gate!

585
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:09,360
Not what you're looking for?

586
00:58:11,227 --> 00:58:14,527
I have hundreds of men here at
Winterfell, all loyal to me.

587
00:58:16,061 --> 00:58:17,770
They're not here now.

588
00:58:19,918 --> 00:58:21,922
What are these?

589
00:58:22,122 --> 00:58:23,538
My faces.

590
00:58:25,897 --> 00:58:27,336
Where did you get them?

591
00:58:27,384 --> 00:58:31,634
In Braavos, while I was
training to be a Faceless Man.

592
00:58:32,466 --> 00:58:34,632
What does that mean?

593
00:58:36,277 --> 00:58:38,032
Back in Braavos,

594
00:58:38,132 --> 00:58:40,337
before I got my first face,

595
00:58:40,735 --> 00:58:42,719
there was a game I used to play.

596
00:58:42,874 --> 00:58:44,797
The Game of Faces.

597
00:58:45,493 --> 00:58:46,671
It's simple...

598
00:58:46,757 --> 00:58:48,977
I ask you a question about yourself,

599
00:58:49,217 --> 00:58:51,883
and you try to make lies
sound like the truth.

600
00:58:52,407 --> 00:58:55,016
If you fool me, you win.

601
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:58,047
If I catch a lie, you lose.

602
00:58:58,959 --> 00:59:00,633
Let's play.

603
00:59:01,629 --> 00:59:03,680
I don't want to play.

604
00:59:04,110 --> 00:59:06,852
How do you feel about Jon being king?

605
00:59:07,713 --> 00:59:10,509
Is there someone else you think
should rule the North instead of him?

606
00:59:10,556 --> 00:59:13,915
Those faces, what are they?

607
00:59:14,453 --> 00:59:16,422
You want to do the asking?

608
00:59:16,947 --> 00:59:18,313
Are you sure?

609
00:59:18,735 --> 00:59:20,399
The Game of Faces
didn't turn out so well

610
00:59:20,454 --> 00:59:21,955
for the last person who
asked me questions.

611
00:59:22,002 --> 00:59:23,961
Tell me what they are.

612
00:59:27,069 --> 00:59:30,236
We both wanted to be other
people when we were younger.

613
00:59:31,159 --> 00:59:33,271
You wanted to be a queen,

614
00:59:33,489 --> 00:59:36,780
to sit next to a handsome,
young king on the Iron Throne.

615
00:59:37,764 --> 00:59:39,904
I wanted to be a knight,

616
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:43,334
to pick up a sword like
Father and go off to battle.

617
00:59:45,464 --> 00:59:48,294
Neither of us got to be
that other person, did we?

618
00:59:49,157 --> 00:59:52,318
The world doesn't just let girls
decide what they're going to be.

619
00:59:53,766 --> 00:59:55,185
But I can now.

620
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:58,185
With the faces, I can choose.

621
00:59:58,969 --> 01:00:01,261
I can become someone else.

622
01:00:01,978 --> 01:00:04,107
Speak in their voice,

623
01:00:04,193 --> 01:00:05,818
live in their skin.

624
01:00:08,604 --> 01:00:11,230
I could even become you.

625
01:00:17,962 --> 01:00:20,363
I wonder what it would feel like

626
01:00:20,699 --> 01:00:22,866
to wear those pretty dresses...

627
01:00:24,479 --> 01:00:26,896
to be the Lady of Winterfell.

628
01:00:29,056 --> 01:00:31,389
All I'd need to find out...

629
01:00:33,288 --> 01:00:34,688
is your face.

630
01:01:30,731 --> 01:01:32,355
I'm sorry.

631
01:01:34,697 --> 01:01:36,488
I'm so sorry.

632
01:01:47,384 --> 01:01:49,675
I wish I could take it back.

633
01:01:51,569 --> 01:01:53,569
I wish we'd never gone.

634
01:01:56,873 --> 01:01:58,373
I don't.

635
01:01:59,970 --> 01:02:02,303
If we hadn't gone, I wouldn't have seen.

636
01:02:04,038 --> 01:02:05,996
You have to see it to know.

637
01:02:07,655 --> 01:02:09,238
Now I know.

638
01:02:12,449 --> 01:02:14,916
The dragons are my children.

639
01:02:15,353 --> 01:02:17,486
They're the only
children I'll ever have.

640
01:02:17,754 --> 01:02:19,378
Do you understand?

641
01:02:25,265 --> 01:02:28,900
We are going to destroy the
Night King and his army.

642
01:02:29,275 --> 01:02:31,150
And we'll do it together.

643
01:02:32,738 --> 01:02:34,780
You have my word.

01:02:37,772 --> 01:02:39,408
Thank you, Dany.

645
01:02:40,877 --> 01:02:42,251
"Dany"?

646
01:02:43,811 --> 01:02:45,978
Who was the last person
who called me that?

647
01:02:47,759 --> 01:02:50,025
I'm not sure. Was it my brother?

648
01:02:50,545 --> 01:02:53,378
Mm, not the company you want to keep.

649
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,102
All right.

650
01:02:57,465 --> 01:02:58,865
Not "Dany."

651
01:03:02,675 --> 01:03:04,675
How about "my queen"?

652
01:03:07,921 --> 01:03:11,687
I'd, uh, bend the knee, but...

653
01:03:11,892 --> 01:03:13,702
What about those who
swore allegiance to you?

654
01:03:13,901 --> 01:03:17,110
They'll all come to see
you for what you are.

655
01:03:32,444 --> 01:03:34,111
I hope I deserve it.

656
01:03:35,929 --> 01:03:37,763
You do.

657
01:03:57,530 --> 01:03:59,196
You should get some rest.

658
01:05:47,550 --> 01:05:51,295

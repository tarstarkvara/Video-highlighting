You are being relocated.

478
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,580
Hey, you can't kick us out of here, man.

479
00:20:17,613 --> 00:20:19,013
Oh, no? I'm a cop.

480
00:20:19,046 --> 00:20:20,913
Thank you, officers.

481
00:20:20,946 --> 00:20:23,046
We've got a deal, right?

482
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,880
Yes.

483
00:20:24,913 --> 00:20:25,913
All right, you. Come on.

484
00:20:25,946 --> 00:20:28,380
Aah!

485
00:20:40,146 --> 00:20:42,580
Please! You can't take
me back to SodoSoPa!

486
00:20:42,613 --> 00:20:43,813
ISIS is there!

487
00:20:43,846 --> 00:20:45,513
No, those were just ninjas.

488
00:20:45,546 --> 00:20:46,880
Ninjas?

489
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:49,246
Oh, that's so gay.

490
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,013
I told you guys.

491
00:20:51,046 --> 00:20:52,080
What did I tell you?

492
00:20:52,113 --> 00:20:53,446
I said ninjas are [bleep] gay,

493
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,413
But you didn't want to listen.

494
00:20:54,446 --> 00:20:55,746
Nooo.

Officer Barbrady?

497
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,546
Yes?

498
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,413
We've been watching you.

499
00:21:07,446 --> 00:21:09,480
And what we see

500
00:21:09,513 --> 00:21:12,213
Is a man who truly wants
to protect his town.

501
00:21:13,546 --> 00:21:15,113
You do?

502
00:21:15,146 --> 00:21:17,513
You've been in this town
longer than almost anyone.

503
00:21:17,546 --> 00:21:20,780
Have you noticed... changes lately?

504
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:22,746
Yeah, a lot of changes.

505
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,013
They aren't a coincidence, officer.

506
00:21:25,046 --> 00:21:26,813
They are all part of a plan

507
00:21:26,846 --> 00:21:30,013
To take down your beloved
town and everyone in it.

508
00:21:30,046 --> 00:21:31,146
What?

509
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:34,113
What do you know about
a little girl named...

Leslie?

2
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:32,699
[announcer]  Line drive to right field...

3
00:00:32,782 --> 00:00:35,785
[man]  Solemnly swear the testimony
you're about to give will be the truth...

4
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:39,831
[Marion Jones]  I have never,
ever failed a drug test.

5
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:43,293
Before, during and after the Olympics.

6
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:47,380
Over 160 drug tests.

7
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:50,467
I have never failed a test.

8
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:54,220
[woman]  For the record,
have you ever used human growth hormone

9
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:57,265
or any other performance-enhancing
substance?

10
00:00:58,015 --> 00:00:59,016
[Lance Armstrong]  No.

11
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:01,144
[man]  I'm trying
to make sure your testimony's clear.

12
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:02,895
[Armstrong]  How many times
do I have to say it?

13
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,314
I've never taken drugs.

14
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,274
[man]  You're winning
the Tour de France...

15
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:07,525
[Armstrong]  How clear is that?

16
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:08,818
[man]  ...win the Tour de France,

17
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:12,197
like the all-time greats
who've ever won this big event.

18
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,407
[Armstrong]  Extraordinary accusations...

19
00:01:14,907 --> 00:01:19,329
must be followed up
with extraordinary proof.

20
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,084
And they have not come up
with extraordinary proof.

21
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:43,520
[Bryan Fogel]  See...

22
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:46,815
We have...

23
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:50,610
...this mountain bike.

24
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:54,447
Loading up the Thule rack.

25
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:59,285
And this is my entire life
in the car right now,

26
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:02,664
set up, ready for insanity.

27
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:08,002
I'm getting ready for the single hardest
amateur cycling event in the world.

28
00:02:08,085 --> 00:02:11,756
It's basically a miniature Tour de France
for insane people.

29
00:02:11,839 --> 00:02:14,926
[man] Does it qualify for anything
if you do well with it?

30
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,219
[Fogel] Yeah, stupidity.

31
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,888
[both laughing]

32
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:25,186
I've been riding for 28 years seriously,
but never as a professional.

33
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,773
Going to these massive amateur events
that are not professional,

34
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:33,987
but, I mean, there's serious guys there.
And the... [laughs]

35
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,365
-Max! He loves... He's got a foot fetish.
-[man laughs] It tickles!

36
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:44,372
[Fogel]  I certainly didn't know
when I started on this

37
00:02:44,872 --> 00:02:46,291
what it was gonna lead to.

38
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:52,129
When LeMond won that first Tour de France,

39
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:54,507
I was in seventh grade, I think.

40
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:58,010
[man]  Can you believe it?
After over 2,000 miles...

41
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:00,137
His name in French means "the world,"

42
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:02,682
and this is the world of Greg LeMond
in Paris today.

43
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:05,142
[Fogel]  Being the first American
to win it,

44
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:07,354
it really brought me into the sport.

45
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,648
I ate a wheel
going about 40 miles an hour.

46
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:15,028
I spent my entire freshman year of college
with plastic teeth in my mouth.

47
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,488
I would've kept racing
if it wasn't for that.

48
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:18,907
[man]  He's really hurting...

49
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:23,160
[Fogel]  Later, Armstrong came along.
That was a whole other ball of wax.

50
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:25,455
[man]  ...off the back wheel
of Armstrong,

51
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,624
-they can't respond to pressure.
-[man 2]  The gap is there.

52
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,167
He is just going faster
and faster and faster.

53
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:32,629
[man]  This has to be
the greatest comeback in any sport.

54
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,632
The fact that Armstrong managed
to conquer cancer was unbelievable.

55
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,468
Now he's riding at the front
of the Tour de France like a Trojan.

56
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:43,640
[Fogel]  I think I'm a year
and a half younger than Lance.

57
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,183
He was kind of my hero.

58
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:51,231
[Oprah Winfrey] For now,
I'd just like a yes or a no.

59
00:03:52,064 --> 00:03:56,027
Did you ever take banned substances
to enhance your cycling performance?

60
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:56,986
Yes.

61
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:06,496
[Fogel]  I'd always suspected
that he had been doping.

62
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:12,001
I felt that I didn't really wanna know.

63
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,881
Because a lot of the guys
that he raced with

64
00:04:16,964 --> 00:04:21,010
and guys who had raced against him
that I'd just known over the years...

65
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,638
they were my friends.

66
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:29,477
If you would've had your choice,
you would've never doped?

67
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,438
-[mutters]
-[Fogel] Ever?

68
00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:34,190
Up until it directly affected me,

69
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,819
I was like, "I think Lance is
probably clean." [chuckles]

70
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,904
[Dave Zabriskie] I don't know.

71
00:04:39,987 --> 00:04:42,324
It's... messy.

72
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:50,164
[Fogel]  The way they got him,
this is what nobody understood.

73
00:04:50,247 --> 00:04:53,000
[Armstrong]  150 times
over the last six years, I've been tested.

74
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:56,463
In competition, out of competition,
at home, at a race,

75
00:04:56,546 --> 00:05:00,008
Seven in the morning, seven at night,
whatever, and they're all clean.

76
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:02,969
[Fogel]  He never failed a drug test.

77
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:04,762
[indistinct chatter]

78
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:08,057
[man]  Solemnly swear the testimony
you're about to give will be the truth?

79
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,685
[Fogel]  It was his teammates
who had turned on him

80
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:12,770
as part of the federal investigation.

81
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:15,064
[crowd cheering]

82
00:05:16,148 --> 00:05:21,613
If this guy had passed, whatever it is,
500 doping tests over his entire career,

83
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,157
clearly the system didn't work.

84
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:30,663
How many times did you test Lance
during his career?

85
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:34,626
[Don Catlin]  As the laboratory of record,

86
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:39,672
I'm estimating that I would've tested him
50 times. 5-0.

87
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:44,093
[Fogel] So you tested Lance 50 times
and never caught him?

88
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:45,887
Correct.

89
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:53,811
I developed and operated
the UCLA Olympic Laboratory for 25 years.

90
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,649
I'm known mostly for developing tests

91
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:01,068
so that athletes get caught
if they're using drugs.

92
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,448
[Fogel] How did you
personally feel every year?

93
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:08,117
Did you believe that it was just Lance?

94
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,497
-Do you think that--
-They're all doping.

95
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,041
Every single one of 'em.

96
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,545
Unfortunately, the drugs work. [chuckles]

97
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:26,678
With certain knowledge, you can
get around the testing all the time.

98
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,556
It's really easy to beat.

99
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,016
Very easy.

100
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:36,145
[Fogel]  Originally, the idea that I had

101
00:06:36,228 --> 00:06:41,776
was to prove the system in place
to test athletes was bullshit.

102
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:48,450
I had read about the hardest
amateur cycling race on the planet,

103
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,034
this seven-day race

104
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,286
through the French Alps,
called the Haute Route.

105
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:59,335
If you were to take the hardest seven days
in the Tour de France,

106
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:02,213
put 'em all together
back-to-back-to-back-to-back,

107
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:05,467
that would be
what this Haute Route course was like.

108
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,680
The first year I did it totally clean.

109
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,559
There were 440 masochists.

110
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,564
My goal was to be in the top 100.

111
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:34,495
After seven days, 75,000 feet of climbing
and 1,000 miles...

112
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:39,501
I was destroyed.

113
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,044
[coughing]

114
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,718
But I finished 14th.

115
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,930
There's about ten guys, it seems,

116
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,934
that are on just another level
than everybody else.

117
00:07:58,435 --> 00:08:01,731
Then there's this next group,
and then there's me.

118
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,777
[Fogel on phone]  What did you think
of the idea?

119
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:09,739
[Catlin]  Well, in certain senses,
I like the idea.

120
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:14,368
It depends on what you consider
to be dangerous...

121
00:08:14,451 --> 00:08:15,495
[Fogel]  Right.

122
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:18,456
[Catlin]  ...testing yourself
on these drugs.

123
00:08:19,331 --> 00:08:23,670
But I was curious, you know,
how you were going to do it.

124
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,673
I might be willing to help
and advise and...

125
00:08:27,464 --> 00:08:29,175
avoid positives.

126
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:33,721
[Zabriskie]  Are you gonna take drugs?

127
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:36,641
Yeah. Basically, go through...

128
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:43,397
go through an entire doping program,
but overseen by the scientist.

129
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:47,819
I'm gonna have Don Catlin design
a program for me

130
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:51,948
that's gonna get through every single one
of the doping controls in the world...

131
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,533
clean.

132
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:10,550
If I could do that
and I could get away with it,

133
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,886
that would mean that pretty much
any athlete could do that

134
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,722
and any athlete could get away with it.

135
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:21,310
[Catlin]  You're going to need a laboratory
to test your body fluids.

136
00:09:21,393 --> 00:09:24,647
[Fogel]  I wasn't sure how I was gonna get
my samples into the lab yet.

137
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:27,233
The only labs
that test professional athletes

138
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:29,360
are WADA-accredited labs.

139
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:33,656
[Catlin]  WADA is
the World Anti-Doping Agency.

140
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:37,827
[Fogel]  The labs are set up
that you can't just go do this.

141
00:09:38,535 --> 00:09:42,456
Because if somebody could just send
their samples into a lab,

142
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:45,209
then anybody could figure out how
to game the system.

143
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,087
And then...

144
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:52,550
[Catlin]  This could damage my reputation
that I've worked on for years...

145
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:55,344
[Fogel]  He just started getting worried
about his legacy.

146
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,222
[Catlin]  My involvement...
it's just not gonna work.

147
00:09:58,514 --> 00:09:59,849
[Fogel]  He backed out.

148
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,769
But, you know, God bless Don Catlin,

149
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:05,813
because he told me
that he knew this guy...

150
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:11,736
[Catlin]  The director of the Olympic lab
in Moscow, Grigory Rodchenkov.

151
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,696
He's a great old friend.

152
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,408
[Fogel]  We talk a few times.
He's in Moscow.

153
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:22,246
And that set off
this whole chain of events.

154
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,710
[ringing]

155
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,381
[woman speaking indistinctly]

156
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:34,383
[Grigory Rodchenkov]  Tell something.

157
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,052
Hi.

158
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,386
Oh! Great.

159
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,847
-It's a secret window. Now it's clean.
-Hmm.

160
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,683
Yeah, you look good now.

161
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,810
-Yes, you, too. Go ahead.
-[chuckles]

162
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:50,232
I met with this guy who's gonna at least,
like, prescribe me the protocol.

163
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,945
What is your ultimate purpose?
You would like to beat doping test?

164
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,197
You would like to start
your hormonal program?

165
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,618
-Yes.
-Then give sample... and prove negative.

166
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:01,703
Yes.

167
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,120
Ha, ha, ha.

168
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:07,374
You need a very serious advisor
because there are a lot of traps.

169
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,044
-[toy squeaking]
-Normally drug-- Okay.

170
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,587
[speaking Russian]

171
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,130
[in English]  My dog is playing.

172
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:16,342
I just came back,
and he's very much excited.

173
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,219
And he has a special toy...

174
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:19,804
-[toy squeaking]
-Yeah, I hear it.

175
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,848
Hey, you wanna see my dog?

176
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,058
-Let me get him.
-Yes.

177
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:27,853
-[chuckles]
-Oh!

178
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,563
[Rodchenkov]  Is it male, female?

179
00:11:29,646 --> 00:11:30,647
Male.

180
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,025
Castrated?

181
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,318
No. [chuckles]

182
00:11:34,401 --> 00:11:35,903
[Rodchenkov]  So with balls?

183
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:37,238
He's got the balls.

184
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:40,532
Yeah. There is the balls. Yes, yes.

185
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:41,617
[all laughing]

186
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,537
-Yeah, this is Max.
- [Rodchenkov]  Max.

187
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,913
Max. Yeah.

188
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:49,500
Testosterone,
you have to have a prescription.

189
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,669
Yes, uh, injectable.

190
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:52,753
Injectable, right.

191
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,922
So, now you are clever, huh?

192
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:56,716
Like Lance Armstrong.

193
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:58,675
Send it to me.

194
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,303
Names, doses, for how long...

195
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,305
So everything should be orchestrated.

196
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,809
[Fogel]  How do I do that?
Just send you everything I'm gonna take?

197
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:09,812
[Rodchenkov]  Yes, your one-month schedule.
Yes.

198
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,441
We've got three medications
that you'll take by injection.

199
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:18,279
-This is five times a week?
-Yeah, it's all on your regimen sheet.

200
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:21,032
We'll draw up half a cc.

201
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,200
-Looks like a big needle.
-It's a tiny needle.

202
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,285
-Really?
-Yeah.

203
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:29,206
Your testosterone comes ready to go.
This is very, very viscous.

204
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,878
It's a very thick substance,
so you need a big needle to draw it up.

205
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:36,964
Then we're gonna pull out.

206
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:39,716
So there's your .2 cc's.

207
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:42,719
And that one goes also in the top
of your thigh.

208
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,180
[inhales sharply]

209
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,974
-I'm a little nervous, but all right.
-Okay.

210
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:48,600
[Scott Brandt] Give me a thigh.

211
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:50,519
And does it hurt the muscle?
Do you flex?

212
00:12:50,602 --> 00:12:53,314
[Brandt] It's not gonna go in your muscle.
It's gonna go above.

213
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:57,026
You just pinch it, and we're just gonna go
just through the skin.

214
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,194
That's it.

215
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,863
And then we're just gonna put that
underneath the skin.

216
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,907
-Did that hurt?
-[Fogel] No, not too bad.

217
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:06,077
-I mean, I see it there.
-It'll go away in no time.

218
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,995
-[Brandt] That's the HCG.
-Oh, shit.

219
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,706
[Brandt] And right next to it,
the testosterone.

220
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:13,417
Pop it through the skin.
That's all we're looking to do.

221
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,711
Just through the skin.
It's real thick now.

222
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,590
-And you are pumped up.
-Whoa!

223
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,258
How long till those bumps go down?

224
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,635
-They'll go quick. Within a half hour.
-Okay. Whoa.

225
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:25,179
And so we begin.

226
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:32,519
[Brandt]  The ability to go day after day
will be brand new for you, I think.

227
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,564
Going to do an injection.

228
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,649
[Fogel]  Exciting.

229
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:42,071
[Brandt]  I work with one trainer
that does a lot of fitness

230
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,990
as well as nutrition coaching.

231
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,699
[Ben Stone] Almost there. Come on, Bryan.

232
00:13:45,782 --> 00:13:48,995
[Brandt]  We should be able to see
a 15 to 20% improvement.

233
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,915
[Fogel]  What's your dog's name again?

234
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,708
[Rodchenkov]  Vrangei.

235
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:57,586
Okay. Did you start your program?

236
00:13:57,669 --> 00:13:59,005
[Fogel]  I did.

237
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,632
This is my morning pill-popping routine.

238
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:06,888
And then I prepare the testosterone.

239
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,307
[Rodchenkov]  Yes, testosterone propionate.

240
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,433
[Fogel]  Yes.

241
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:14,395
It's really thick.

242
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:18,774
What made you think
that Grigory might help me?

243
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:23,112
Well, it's difficult for me
to answer that without...

244
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:28,367
saying things about Grigory
that aren't very kind.

245
00:14:29,826 --> 00:14:32,246
Okay, let me think.

246
00:14:34,706 --> 00:14:37,209
-So, you've already did it for two weeks?
-[dog pants]

247
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,044
-He's fucking me.
-[Fogel laughing]

248
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,797
He's fucking me.  [speaking Russian]

249
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:46,093
[in English]  Just pee
and collect your urine today.

250
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:47,844
And drop into the freezer.

251
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:51,974
So just pee, take some urine
and put it in the freezer?

252
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:52,892
In the freezer.

253
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,938
There's day eight, day ten...

254
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:58,689
Needle.

255
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,446
The testosterone with the HGH,

256
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:08,991
it's a weird feeling because
it doesn't feel like I'm on anything.

257
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:12,369
Are you now training?
And you feel a little bit stronger?

258
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,788
Yeah, I really felt stronger.

259
00:15:14,871 --> 00:15:16,165
That's good.

260
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:20,252
Forty milligrams each other day
is a very good protocol.

261
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:25,049
[Fogel]  I still had no idea
why a WADA lab director

262
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,259
who did all the testing
for the Sochi Olympics

263
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,678
would agree to do this,

264
00:15:29,761 --> 00:15:34,766
because his job was supposed to be
to catch athletes.

265
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:38,645
So you want me to do 24,000 units
in one month?

266
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:39,605
Yes.

267
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:42,024
[Fogel] Fuck, man. That's a lot of EPO.

268
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,777
[Rodchenkov]  You have just common fears,
and it's paranoia.

269
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:50,282
We are imitating... We are reproducing
Lance Armstrong's scenario.

270
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:54,620
I'm getting kind of bruises
all over my legs.

271
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:57,664
Don't disturb your thigh at all.
Stop it.

272
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:02,003
You can inject into your thigh muscle,
but better to the ass.

273
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,171
[Fogel stammers]  Into my ass?

274
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:05,256
[Rodchenkov]  Much more!

275
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,340
[Fogel]  Okay.

276
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:09,093
This is starting to get ridiculous.

277
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:10,677
Ow!

278
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:13,847
Wow! I'm bleeding from that.
[inhales sharply] Okay.

279
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,268
Oh, fuck, I'm really bleeding
from that one, too.

280
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,228
Let me get some alcohol.

281
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,524
Um, okay, so then a half of this one.

282
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:29,405
[inhales deeply]

283
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,032
Oh, fuck!

284
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,741
[sighs]

285
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:37,246
Um... [grunts]

286
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:41,583
Okay.

287
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,753
So, that's that.

288
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:50,175
He was like, [in Russian accent]
"You don't do subcutaneous.

289
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,302
You put it right into your ass.

290
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:55,305
-[laughing]
-No, we go one inch into buttocks.

291
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,349
Show me that bottle again."

292
00:16:57,974 --> 00:16:59,226
[Stone]  You're kidding me.

293
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,980
[Rodchenkov]  Have you seen movie with me?

294
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,773
-No.
-Separate movie.

295
00:17:04,856 --> 00:17:06,650
-Which movie?
-No?

296
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,277
About me.

297
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,115
[man]  All athletes in Russia are doping.

298
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,121
The athletes that are
under Mr. Rodchenkov,

299
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:20,831
they don't get positive tests.

300
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:28,755
[narrator in German]  The laboratory was
internationally recognized for research.

301
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,092
Its head scientist is considered
an outstanding scientist.

302
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,718
Grigory Rodchenkov.

303
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,888
[woman in Russian]  Dr. Rodchenkov
is informed about everything.

304
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:41,060
He knows how long the drugs need
to disappear from the body.

305
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:44,438
He is aware and instructs.
He's the most important specialist.

306
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:49,651
[Fogel]  The ARD documentary
regarding the Russian whistle-blowers...

307
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:53,655
what did you think,
hearing these allegations?

308
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,409
It was inflammatory enough
that they were afraid to run it

309
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,496
while the whistle-blowers were still
in Russia.

310
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,291
So they got them out of Russia,
ran the program,

311
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,502
and it was a bombshell.

312
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:10,631
[man]  99% of Russian athletes
are guilty of doping.

313
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:14,551
That's according to a recent
German documentary aired on ARD.

314
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:18,347
[woman]  WADA's president,
Craig Reedie, promised an investigation,

315
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,890
effective immediately.

316
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,684
[Craig Reedie]  It is wrong just to make
any kind of assumption

317
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,561
on allegations in the media.

318
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:28,690
Athletes must be presumed
to be innocent until proven guilty.

319
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:32,944
These are wild allegations,
and we'll have to check them out.

320
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,447
[Richard McLaren]
Reedie had to do something.

321
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:38,950
That's how the Independent Commission
was created.

322
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:44,290
I had investigative experience
for a decade and a half,

323
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,792
and some big investigations,

324
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:50,171
like US Olympic Committees
and Major League Baseball.

325
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:54,258
[man]  And Bonds hits one high!
It's a ding!

326
00:18:55,801 --> 00:19:00,347
Our mandate was athletics,
track and field and Russia.

327
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,976
The WADA chairman
named this Independent Commission

328
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,770
and said, "Let's get at it."

329
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:10,774
[man]  The Anti-Doping Agency
wants a report by the end of the year,

330
00:19:10,857 --> 00:19:13,277
and athletics officials say
they'll cooperate.

331
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,779
It's unclear, though,
what actions might be taken.

332
00:19:15,862 --> 00:19:17,156
Thomas Daigle, CBC News.

333
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,408
[Fogel]  Is it gonna be okay?
Is it gonna pass over?

334
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,617
Is this gonna cause you--

335
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,453
No, no, no. It's growing.

336
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:23,537
It's growing?

337
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,164
It's like a tornado coming.

338
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:30,211
Okay, so you are receiving how many units?

339
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:35,591
[Fogel] Grigory, the Moscow scientist
I was showing you,

340
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,050
who did all the testing for Sochi,

341
00:19:37,133 --> 00:19:41,305
who's now at the center
of this big Russian doping scandal.

342
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,724
Russia was doping their athletes
in the '80s.

343
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:47,018
-Apparently, they've never stopped.
-Really?

344
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,396
[Fogel]  The crazy thing is, Richard Pound,

345
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,899
the guy who was the head of WADA
for 15 years,

346
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:58,029
has actually been hired
to lead the investigation against Grigory.

347
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:01,825
Um... I don't know
what you want me to do with that.

348
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:03,702
Meaning?

349
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:07,038
I don't know how...
Shit. My computer's about to die.

350
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:09,040
I don't know how...

351
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:13,712
-Let me grab my power cord. I'll be back.
-Do you have a charger? All right.

352
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:20,302
There might be someone else out there
that might be a better decision or choice.

353
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:23,930
You're using this guy as your coach.
What's your comfort level?

354
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:27,351
-Here's how I'm looking at it...
-You can find someone else.

355
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:32,481
I guess you call it "doping doctors."
I don't know what you would label Grigory.

356
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,691
Is he a biochemist? I don't even know.

357
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:38,153
It doesn't even matter.
I don't like this shit.

358
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:41,990
[Fogel]  Look,
there's no finding someone else.

359
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,795
[Brandt]  Your numbers look great.

360
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:57,839
Your testosterone is pretty much
right where we want you.

361
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:02,553
Grigory, what's the typical wash-out
for urine to go to negative

362
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,763
from a full treatment of testosterone?

363
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:07,015
How many days does that take usually?
Seven?

364
00:21:07,098 --> 00:21:10,101
[Rodchenkov]  For Bryan,
two weeks will be nice.

365
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:12,938
Is there any way that we could test
that here in the States,

366
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:16,107
or it's gotta go back to you
to test those frozen urines?

367
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:19,778
It's the only way.
But again, I am under heavy control.

368
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:23,865
WADA now, they have an inquiry about me.

369
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:24,866
[Brandt]  Yes.

370
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,329
So you see, like, me...
I'm a very dangerous person.

371
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:33,375
How do you think is the best way
to basically get that test done?

372
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,502
Maybe, hopefully...

373
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:38,714
I would like to do this,
to come to, maybe, LA,

374
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:42,301
and to smuggle something to Russia.
Some urines from you.

375
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,928
Um... [stammers]

376
00:21:45,011 --> 00:21:48,307
Could we send 'em to Salt Lake City
or another lab?

377
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,559
No, no, no. It's strictly prohibited.

378
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:57,232
[indistinct chatter]

379
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,822
You are so skinny! [speaking Russian]

380
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:05,824
You're  skinny.

381
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:06,783
No!

382
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:11,163
[Fogel]  All the urine in my freezer,
we have to unfreeze it?

383
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:13,665
[Rodchenkov]  Yes, we unfreeze,
then we homogenize

384
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,751
to make sure everything is melted.

385
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:20,339
I took special bottles
for smuggling urine, and...

386
00:22:21,047 --> 00:22:24,175
we will make a scenario
like I am collecting my urine.

387
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:26,344
"Grigory one, morning."

388
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,847
"Evening, 28th. Grigory two."

389
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,057
Then we recode them.

390
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:33,268
Perfect.

391
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:35,437
Otherwise, what is the source
of the urine and why?

392
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:36,522
Right.

393
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,524
The goal during
this two- to three-week period

394
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:42,235
is to push you to an extreme
on a chronic level, not just acute.

395
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:44,613
-Okay, we--
-[Fogel] Max!

396
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,156
He loves me.

397
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,365
[Fogel] Yeah. Max--

398
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,242
No, no, don't kick Max. It's okay.

399
00:22:49,325 --> 00:22:52,287
-Max, go away. Out.
-No, no, no.

400
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,915
It's not good time.

401
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:56,875
-[laughing]
-Later.

402
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:04,925
[Stone] A fifteen-second acceleration
whenever you want. Good.

403
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,386
We need girls, cheerleaders.

404
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:12,766
[Stone] Right? Exactly.
Maybe we should get you some pom-poms.

405
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:14,851
-And like this...
-Right.

406
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:20,607
[Rodchenkov]  I was working here in 1989,
when Catlin was in big power.

407
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:24,027
Laboratory was located in UCLA.
The campus.

408
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:28,615
[Catlin]  Twenty years ago,
we had decided to develop a way to get

409
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:32,410
actually friendly
with what was then the Soviets.

410
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:36,873
We, the US,
would invite Soviets to come to the US

411
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:40,251
and pick and choose athletes
that they wanted to test,

412
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:44,297
bring 'em in and test them
where the Soviets were watching.

413
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:48,093
Grigory was the first representative.

414
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:53,432
He shows up at the second day of work
in bright orange shorts

415
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:58,812
and announces that he's gonna enter
the Santa Monica Marathon.

416
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:00,897
And he won the darn thing.

417
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:03,358
He's a good athlete.

418
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:07,403
[Rodchenkov]  I was almost
a professional in running.

419
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:11,533
1,500 meters and five kilometers
at Moscow University.

420
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:15,954
My mother always pushed me
to swim, to ski.

421
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,000
I realized that some people
are using something.

422
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:24,004
Last year, he was nobody.
Next year, he has muscles.

423
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:27,883
Of course, I also started
to use the best of the best,

424
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:29,468
stanozolol.

425
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,346
And all injections were done by my mother.

426
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:37,267
And, of course, it was 50 milligrams,
this simple thing.

427
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:40,228
[Fogel] Wait, wait.
Your  mother  injected you?

428
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:41,897
Yes, of course.

429
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:47,736
But if you are not national team level,
like Olympic,

430
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,614
you cannot afford any more training camp.

431
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:55,327
So, I graduated to Moscow University,
to the chemical department.

432
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:59,080
I liked doping control. I liked sports.

433
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:04,377
And since 1985, I worked in the top field
of laboratories in the world.

434
00:25:06,212 --> 00:25:09,424
And then, Moscow laboratory
was doing mistake by mistake.

435
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:12,803
"We need a new director,
and it will be upheld by WADA."

436
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,806
That's how I became director.

437
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:25,231
[Fogel] Should I be taking the HGH
and the testosterone now?

438
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:26,733
[Rodchenkov] Let's look at your protocol.

439
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:30,946
I have to sketch all schematics,
starting from the new year.

440
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,823
-We'll sit down with a piece of paper.
-Yes.

441
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:35,491
With the piss and then with the tubes.

442
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:37,869
We take just a fraction.

443
00:25:38,369 --> 00:25:41,289
And then it will be coded
and took for analysis.

444
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:45,001
So, here's day one. Okay?
Here's day two.

445
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:48,463
Here's day three, day four, day five.

446
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:50,465
[Rodchenkov] Seven, eight, nine.

447
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,802
We have nine urines. Okay.

448
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:56,763
-So we are starting--
-[Fogel] And that one, I just took.

449
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:58,974
Is that enough? Or do I need any more?

450
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,058
It's okay.

451
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,142
[Fogel] Okay.

452
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:04,646
-Three, three, three.
-I hear you got the real code.

453
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,856
I am mafia.

454
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,233
This is mafia.

455
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:09,985
[laughing]

456
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:13,697
Chased by WADA.

457
00:26:15,406 --> 00:26:19,535
Could you imagine, the best laboratory
will be puzzled with your piss?

458
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:22,789
In Russia, the empire of evil.

459

-Oh, God. What is that?

It's flakes. Your flakes.

in September, after the race, I can drink.

Okay, next time. Next time, if I survive.

468
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:21,348
At my lab, WADA is keeping laboratory
on a very short leash. Leash?

469
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:23,266
Asking many questions.

470
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,560
All sort of bullshit.

471
00:27:26,602 --> 00:27:28,354

underground laboratory for pre-testing?

473

Where is the shadow laboratory?"

00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:40,867
Of course, my laboratory is fully under...

cameras and everything,
computers, barcodes...

476

But they were looking for something.

-Like a secret lab?
-Yes, yes, yes, yes, underground.

-The state.
-The state does?

Yes.

Be very careful
with what you are recording.

It's not permitted.
It's like pornography and erotics.

00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,262
[Rodchenkov] Yes, definitely.

498
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,935
[Fogel]  Did you go to Moscow?

499
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,354
No, I did not, and Dick Pound did not.

500
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:57,485
We wanted to send an investigative group
of WADA specialists into the Moscow lab.

501
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:01,740
The director of the lab,
he was the last fail-safe position, right?

502
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:04,034
If there is a sample
that's potentially positive,

00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:06,077
where can you stop it from being reported?

504
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,120
In the lab.

505
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:11,249
So he was interviewed.
Didn't provide us with much information.

506

[Fogel]  Please tell me all my frozen piss

Bryan, I have all urines.

510
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:25,596
We analyzed urines
for your steroid profile.

-Okay.

00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:38,443
[Rodchenkov]  We did preliminary tests,
but not much.

514
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,904
When WADA will leave...

515
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:43,073
They are leaving tomorrow night.

Then maybe Friday,
or maybe Monday, anyway--

[Rodchenkov]  It's much more challenging.

519
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:52,999
WADA is sniffing
and asking tons of questions.

-Dick Pound... You know, Dick Pound?
-Yes

it's very difficult to prove something.

or the solution as?

You just focus on racing.

Come on, you got it.
Come on. Four, two, one.

This is already better than last time.

Last year, 250 watts. This year, 349.
It's 100 watts.

to Europe, right?

and the customs.

the French Cycling Federation calendar,

545
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:20,253
and we do have an anti-doping policy.

546
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:24,174
[Fogel]  As far as testing for PEDs,
the race says that they do.

547
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:26,509
They may come and test,
just so you're aware.

548
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:29,470
[Fogel]  As I came to learn, they don't.

549
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,849
-[Rodchenkov]  Don't worry.
-[Fogel]  But I had Grigory.

550
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:35,435
He had helped me dope,

551
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:40,690
and he was gonna test my samples
through his WADA lab in Moscow.

552
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:42,483
[Rodchenkov]  So, be clever.

553
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:46,321
I have not done a urine sample
since I've been here.

554
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,489
You are like a pioneer.

555
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,910
[Fogel] So I'm gonna pee
in this little bag here.

556
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,162
[Rodchenkov]  You are a victim
of your ideas.

557
00:31:55,621 --> 00:31:58,458
August 21st.

558
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:01,753

[Stone]  You did great.

572
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:19,998
You were three and a half minutes
behind Pouly.

-[Fogel] That's not bad.
-No, that's fucking great.

He's in there with the top ten guys.

are incredible.

00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:44,647
[Rodchenkov]  Very good.

00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:46,066

582
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:07,378
Can't raise him on the walkie-talkie.

The battery's dead.
It needed to be charged.

587

Now it won't go up. You see?
Dead. It's totally dead.

00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,856
[Fogel] Fuck!

589
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:31,778
[Fogel]  My derailleur, my shifting,
it broke.

590
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:33,404
-[Rodchenkov]  Your bike?
-Yes.

591
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:38,368
[Rodchenkov]  You cannot shift your gears?

592
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,703
[Fogel]  For 100 kilometers.

593
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:43,748
[Rodchenkov]  My goodness.

594
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:49,754
-I dropped ten places in the rankings.
-Okay. Hmm.

00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:52,507
My God.

596
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,762
[Fogel]  I feel
that I'm really stronger this year.

597
00:34:57,845 --> 00:35:00,265
-Like, that I'm recovering.
-[Brandt]  Yeah.

598
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:03,058
[Fogel]  I mean, I'm hauling ass,
but they're...

599
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:05,603
I'm not beating 'em.
They're in a different--

600
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:09,857
There's guys that I don't know
that you could've beat on your best day.

601
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,406
[Fogel]  My whole plan was

602
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:21,119
to have a substantially
better performance this year.

603
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:23,579
And...

604
00:35:24,955 --> 00:35:25,998
I'm not.

605
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,377
[Stone] Did you just get separated
or what?

606
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,753
Neutral descent now?

607
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:35,383
[man]  Does it hurt that you did
better last year than you did this year?

608
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:41,013
I mean, I could have been 21 years old

609
00:35:41,096 --> 00:35:43,933
and taken all the blood bags
and EPO in the world,

610
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:47,687
and I was still not going to be
a Tour de France champion.

611
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,689
It doesn't matter.

612
00:35:54,109 --> 00:35:56,279
[Rodchenkov]  Just stay optimistic.

613
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:00,325
Because now, we can change nothing.

614
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:10,042
[announcer]  The winner, Peter Pouly.

615
00:36:10,125 --> 00:36:11,126
[crowd applauds]

616
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,632
-[Fogel]  I felt pretty good. I just had--
-[Rodchenkov]  No, no, no.

617
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,384
[Fogel]  I've just had some bad luck days.

618
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:19,760
[Rodchenkov]  Bryan, look at me.

619
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,430
Stop it.

620
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:25,850
You are what you are. I am what I am.

621
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:30,897
It's a turning point, what we are doing.

622
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:36,236
You should be happy
that we have such fantastic material.

623
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:42,658
We have ten times more information
than Dick Pound and Armstrong together.

624
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:45,203
-[Fogel]  Really?
-We will continue. Don't worry.

625
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:49,249
You are just like in the reception.
You did not enter the first floor.

626
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:51,459
Then there is a second and so on.

627
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,420
[Fogel]  What's on the second floor?

628
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:57,131
[Rodchenkov]  When you go to Moscow,
you will see.

629
00:37:12,062 --> 00:37:13,606
[Fogel]  So cool.

630
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:17,277
How many tests...
I've probably had 15 or 20 blood tests.

631
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,445
-[Rodchenkov] It's more than enough.
-Okay.

632
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:22,531
-[Fogel] Is this the laboratory?
-Yes.

633
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:26,035
Oh, you see, this is bloody RUSADA.

634
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:30,498
Bringing samples, it's not too good
to show our camera to them.

635
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:33,251
-[Fogel] Oh. You want us to hide?
-Yes, yes, yes.

636
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,585
[Fogel] Okay.

637
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,879
Be very careful with all your material.

638
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:39,590
-People are very sensitive also, you know.
-[Fogel] Yes.

639
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:43,303
This is my director place.

640
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,514
It's the most famous laboratory
in the world.

641
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:53,479
We cannot say explicitly
that you have been analyzed.

642
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:56,857
It's coming.
I already solved everything yesterday.

643
00:37:56,941 --> 00:38:01,195
You will have it until, let's say...
Within two weeks, we will do this.

644
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:04,574
But it should be done still,
say, under the table, not...

645
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:06,867
-[Fogel] Okay.
-Okay. [clears throat]

646
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:12,290
[Rodchenkov] Smile. Your race is over.
We have to go downstairs.

647
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:18,838
[Fogel]  Are there scientists,

648
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:22,007
or those working
in WADA laboratories today,

649
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:25,345
that you suspect
could have been corrupted?

650
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,388
[Rodchenkov]  Each director of laboratory,
like me...

651
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:29,515
I have to sign a code of ethics,

652
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,435
that what we are doing
is not harmful or detrimental

653
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:34,854
to the whole anti-doping society.

654
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:42,027
We go down this emergency exit.

655
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:51,161
[Fogel]  What did Russia have to do

656
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:56,041
with the hiding blood passports
of all the athletes?

657
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,043
[Rodchenkov] Let's talk in my office.

658
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:04,967
If you hide fight against doping,
you cannot be 50% honest.

659
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:09,013
You have to be honest,
or you have to hide the ends.

660
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:11,807
It's the same as Orwell,  1984.

661
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:15,102
WADA is like a religion,
and you cannot escape.

662
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:18,981
You have to think about money,
but you cannot steal money.

663
00:39:19,064 --> 00:39:21,233
You have to think about women,

664
00:39:21,316 --> 00:39:24,194
but you have to be married
and don't go to prostitution.

665
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:25,279
But again...

666
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:30,200
almost everybody has some period
when they were sinners.

667
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:31,369
So what to do?

668
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,413
There is no answer.

669
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:39,919
[Fogel]  For the last five months,
I took urine and then I did blood--

670
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:41,796
[Rodchenkov]  Yes, we have a good database.

671
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:47,718
How do we go about the analysis?
What do we wanna show?

672
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:51,180
How do we put together

673
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:54,183
-the bigger story arc?
-Bryan, be optimistic.

674
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:56,101
-[chuckles]
-Smile.

675
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,313
I have vodka for you.

676
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,482
-You do?
-Yes.

677
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,359
-The best vodka.
-What kind?

678
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:05,778
From Mordovia.

679
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:07,321
-Oh, awesome!
-You do drink vodka?

680
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:10,282
-Yeah, I like vodka.
-You like-- I have vodka for you.

681
00:40:10,365 --> 00:40:14,203
I've decided I'm not gonna leave Russia.
I'm gonna stay here.

682
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:15,663
You would like to stay?

683
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:19,709
Russia is the most relaxing country
in the world.

684
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:20,918
You think?

685
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:23,504
-No.
-[both laughing]

686
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:32,763
[Fogel] You having fun?

687
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:34,682
Yes, we have fun!

688
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:36,684
Smile.

689
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,105
[speaking Russian]

690
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:44,692
Bryan!

691
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,444
[singing in Russian]

692
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,163
[indistinct chatter]

693
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:19,393
[man]  Ladies and gentlemen,
members of the media, welcome to Geneva.

694
00:41:20,185 --> 00:41:23,272
Almost a year ago,
very serious doping allegations

695
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:26,484
were first raised
on German television channel ARD.

696
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:29,403
The WADA president, Sir Craig Reedie,

697
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:32,948
announced that a full and thorough inquiry
would be conducted.

698
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:36,911
The founding president
of the World Anti-Doping Agency,

699
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:39,664
Mr. Dick Pound,
the chair of that commission.

700
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:46,921
Overwhelming portions of the allegations
made on the ARD program

701
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:51,133
have been found
by the Independent Commission to be true.

702
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:54,136
It's worse than we thought.
We have found cover-ups.

703
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:57,431
We found destruction
of samples in the laboratories.

704
00:41:58,348 --> 00:42:03,187
We found payments of money
in order to conceal doping tests...

705
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:05,272
among others.

706
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:09,735
Our conclusion was that all
of this could not have happened,

707
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:12,404
and continue to happen,
without the knowledge of

708
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:17,159
and either actual or implied consent
of the state authorities.

709
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:18,494
[Fogel] You reading this?

710
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:22,206
Forty pages of this report is Grigory.

711
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:25,417
It's hard to imagine

712
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:29,964
what the Russian state interest
in athletes' urine would be.

713
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:35,219
One of our big concerns about tests
were the 1,400 that were destroyed

714
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:37,930
by the director of the Moscow laboratory.

715
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:42,142
In fact, our recommendation
is the director of the laboratory

716
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:46,521
be removed from his position,
that the WADA accreditation be withdrawn,

717
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:48,941
and the Russian Federation be suspended.

718
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:51,860
[line ringing]

719
00:42:53,278 --> 00:42:55,114
-[Veronika]  Bryan, hi.
-[Fogel] Hi.

720
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:58,283
Where did Grigory go?

721
00:42:58,367 --> 00:42:59,534
I've been crying.

722
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,704
Yes, I am with him,

723
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:04,289
and I think maybe you want
to speak with him.

724
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:06,166
Maybe he's a little bit nervous.

725
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,670
-I'm so sorry.
-[Rodchenkov]  Bryan.

726
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:14,049
I'm not-- I'm sorry. I'm trying
to understand what you're saying.

727
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:18,428
[Rodchenkov]  I'm absolutely saying
that we will overturn all this bullshit,

728
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:20,430
and it will be upside down.

729
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:23,267
So, Bryan,
I hardly could talk to you tonight.

730
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:24,476
[line disconnects]

731
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:26,687
[woman]  The details are damning

732
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:29,899
and could have a profound impact
on the future of Russian athletics.

733
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:32,902
[man]  This WADA commission
has accused Russian athletics

734
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:35,279
of state-sponsored doping.

735
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:45,289
[in Russian] We are preparing our response
to again provide any explanation needed.

736
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:48,042
That's all I can say at this point.

737
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:52,379
Does this mean they could potentially miss
next year's Olympics?

738
00:43:52,462 --> 00:43:55,174
Well, that is certainly
one of the potential outcomes here.

739
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:58,803
[man]  The International Olympic Committee
have released a statement.

740
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:03,015
You will see athletes
being sanctioned by the IAAF.

741
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:07,477
You will see athletes
and officials being excluded.

742
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:11,816
And you will see an action led by the IOC.

743
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:14,902
We'll apply this zero-tolerance policy.

744
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:18,030
[man]  Decision time for the IAAF

745
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:20,407
on whether Russia's
track and field athletes

746
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:23,327
will be allowed
to compete at the Rio Olympics.

747
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:27,081
I want to hear
what the Athletics Federation of Russia

748
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:29,583
is actually saying
in answer to those allegations.

749
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:32,753
[man]  The Sports Minister,
Vitaly Mutko, has said,

750
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:36,924
"Russia took all the necessary measures,"
he says, "to fight the doping problem.

751
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,759
Moscow's anti-doping lab

752
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:41,887
was recently recognized
as one of the best in the world."

753
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:46,141
You don't want to talk to us?

754
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:50,771
Well, the employees at this lab
are clearly being very tight-lipped,

755
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:54,608
but the report
from the World Anti-Doping Agency

756
00:44:54,691 --> 00:44:56,235
goes into great detail

757
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:59,654
describing the alleged activities
inside that building.

758
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:02,867
[Rodchenkov]  There are around
50 correspondents

759
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:05,786
behind my fence, but I am here.

760
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:07,662
And I am not supposed to talk.

761
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,415
Bryan, stay quiet.

762
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:14,754
You're a lucky man.
Only you, knowing me.

763
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:16,463
[Skype call ends]

764
00:45:17,547 --> 00:45:18,799
Holy shit.

765
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:26,557
The World Anti-Doping Agency suspended
Russia's sports drug-testing lab,

766
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,725
and the head of the lab resigned.

767
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:37,943
[Veronika in Russian]  Grisha,
be careful what you tell him now.

768
00:45:38,027 --> 00:45:40,029
[Rodchenkov]  Don't tell me. I am just--

769
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:42,197
[Veronika]  They're holding
on the phone for you.

770
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:45,200
-[Rodchenkov]  Tell them I'll call back--
-[Veronika]  It sounds serious.

771
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:47,119
[Rodchenkov]
I'll call back in five minutes!

772
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:51,123
-[Veronika]  Okay, but will you?
-[Rodchenkov]  Yes, go away!

773
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:52,833
[Veronika]  Fine.

774
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:54,376
[Rodchenkov]  Bryan...

775
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,921
[in English]  It's a disaster.

776
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:58,505
They're just killing people.

777
00:45:58,588 --> 00:46:01,383
Cutting heads, you know,
without who is guilty.

778
00:46:01,466 --> 00:46:04,219
Yesterday, you know,
I went to Minister Mutko,

779
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:06,138
and we started to discuss.

780
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:09,349
He was talking,
blah, blah, blah, about football.

781
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:12,269
Uh, blah, blah, blah, about Formula 1.

782
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:15,815
Then to say what to do with bloody doping.

783
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:18,901
But he say, "Could you resign?"
I go, "Yes."

784
00:46:19,776 --> 00:46:22,321
"Today?" "Yes, today."

785
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:24,198
And I resigned.

786
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,241
And...

787
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:28,618
they lost director.

788
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:31,830
I have a lot of calls,
but I'm just changing my telephones.

789
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:37,294
People are looking for their job,
but laboratory is almost empty.

790
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:38,212
Empty.

791
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:41,173
I don't know what's going on.

792
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:44,510
I just know what I'm reading
in the newspaper and in the press and...

793
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:45,719
You know.

794
00:46:45,802 --> 00:46:47,179
Oh, really? Really?

795
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:50,807
I mean, will they come after you?

796
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:53,185
Are they gonna arrest you?
Are they gonna...

797
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:55,770
Would they try to put you in jail?

798
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,898
In jail? No.

799
00:46:57,982 --> 00:46:59,566
What is the reason for jail?

800
00:46:59,649 --> 00:47:00,567
-You know.
-No.

801
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:02,527
Are you in any danger?

802
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:08,242
Yes, but not jail.
It could be some... I don't know.

803
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:12,371
-I mean--
-Do you know that I am now moving

804
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:13,914
with a security man?

805
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:15,249
Security guard.

806
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:16,208
No.

807
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:19,003
Just a security guard in my home.

808
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:20,921
-In your home?
-Coming to my car.

809
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:22,297
I'm following behind.

810
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:25,634
It's recommended
until the end of the week,

811
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:28,470
because I am the only man
who can kill both sides.

812
00:47:28,553 --> 00:47:29,930
Russia and WADA, so...

813
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:31,765
Stay quiet.

814
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:34,894
[Vitaly Mutko in Russian]  Let me say this.

815
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:39,023
In reality,
the Independent Commission's report

816
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:42,943
and statements made by Mr. Pound
are exaggerated.

817
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:46,196
We've even built a modern,
state-of-the-art anti-doping laboratory

818
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:49,616
that is renowned for its testing

819
00:47:49,699 --> 00:47:54,746
for the Olympics, Paralympics,
championships and more,

820
00:47:54,829 --> 00:47:57,666
and received the highest merits
for its contributions.

821
00:47:57,749 --> 00:48:00,460
The government is merely financing
the laboratory operation.

822
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:03,672
[Rodchenkov in English]  They don't accept
this Independent Commission at all.

823
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:06,550
They're deliberately lying.

824
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:08,510
Bryan, Bryan...

825
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:10,637
-look at me.
-[Fogel] Okay.

826
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:15,142
[Rodchenkov]  It means I could be tossed
under the bus anytime.

827
00:48:15,935 --> 00:48:18,895
I'm not sure
that we are connecting freely.

828
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:21,773
Because now we are on radar,
that's for sure.

829
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:24,401
You know Snowden?

830
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:26,111
Yeah, of course.

831
00:48:26,861 --> 00:48:29,364
Now you see.  [clicks tongue]

832
00:48:30,532 --> 00:48:32,742
We still don't know...
We still don't know

833
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:36,080
whether Russia is participating
in Olympic Games or not.

834
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:41,084
The outcome, why I am very much
cautious about my life...

835
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:45,547
If me will be purged...

836
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:48,175
okay, Russia will go to the Olympics.

837
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:51,511
[clicking tongue]
The problem is to survive.

838
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:53,347
-Listen, I, uh...
-Yes.

839
00:48:53,973 --> 00:48:56,558
-Joking, you know, seriousness aside...
-Stop it. Stop, stop.

840
00:48:56,641 --> 00:48:59,811
I'm just... I'm worried about you.

841
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:01,605
Yes, yes.

842
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:03,565
Tomorrow, I drop you.

843
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:07,319
And then, when I say...  [clicks tongue]

844
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:12,616
"How is weather in Los Angeles?"
or anything related to weather...

845
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:18,038
it means that we will talk
in 15, 20 minutes.

846
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:19,123
Be ready to talk.

847
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:26,713
[Sebastian Coe]  Tonight, our sport
finds itself in a shameful situation.

848
00:49:26,796 --> 00:49:31,926
And that is why I can confirm
the council has overwhelmingly voted,

849
00:49:32,011 --> 00:49:35,389
with immediate effect,
to suspend the Russian Federation.

850
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:39,476
It's done so, uh, by 22 votes to one.

851
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:43,522
It is the strongest sanction...
[continues indistinctly]

852
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:57,452
[in Russian] Regarding the recent events

853
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:01,540
connected to our track and field team,

854
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:06,628
I urge the sports minister
and all my sports colleagues

855
00:50:06,711 --> 00:50:09,173
to make this their number one priority.

856
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:10,424
This is the first step.

857
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:14,678
Secondly, it is vital to conduct
our own internal investigation.

858
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:18,432
[clears throat] Sport should be fair.

859
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:23,395
Responsibility should be personalized
and absolute.

860
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:28,817
[Rodchenkov]  Bryan...

861
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:32,571
I need... Wait, look at me.

862
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:33,738
Yeah.

863
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:37,159
I need to escape and to walk... to walk...

864
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:38,868
You can go wherever you want.

865
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:42,831
-Okay.
-I will be doggy-sitting at your home.

866
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:44,583
So you wanna get out?

867
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:47,043
Yes. Simply.

868
00:50:48,002 --> 00:50:50,547
What do you want to, uh...

869
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:53,175
It's very suspicious when you have
one-way ticket, you know.

870
00:50:53,258 --> 00:50:57,096
Yeah, right.
You have to book a round trip.

871
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:58,805
[Veronika in Russian]  They're watching us.

872
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:01,141
-[Rodchenkov]  Bryan?
-Yeah.

873
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:04,311
[Rodchenkov]  What I am doing,
myself, I can do nothing.

874
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:06,188
-So...
-Okay?

875
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:07,647
[stammering]

876
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:11,235
I'll send you... Let me figure out
some flight options, okay?

877
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:13,362
Okay.

878
00:51:14,779 --> 00:51:16,615
[Fogel]  I'm gonna get the flight,
right now.

879
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:18,575
-[Rodchenkov]  Yes, right now.
-Okay.

880
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:19,784
[Rodchenkov]  Go.

881
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:23,122
Also, some security measures will be set.

882
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:26,250
[Fogel]  How will I know
that you made it through okay?

883
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:27,167
[Rodchenkov]  Um...

884
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:30,086
I don't know.

885
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:32,214
Okay?

886
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,341
Okay.

887
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:36,843
[both] Okay.

888
00:51:39,053 --> 00:51:41,097
-[Rodchenkov]  Bryan?
-Yeah, I'm right here.

889
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:44,226
-Okay, just left my security man.
-[Fogel]  Okay.

890
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:46,936
[Rodchenkov]  I am very much dizzy,
paranoid.

891
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,313
[Fogel]  We'll get you here.

892
00:51:48,397 --> 00:51:53,109
[Rodchenkov]  My wife and children decided
maybe it's better to stay in Russia.

893
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:57,572
[Fogel]  Just gotta make sure in the US
that you're okay also.

894
00:51:58,156 --> 00:51:59,491
[Rodchenkov]  My daughter...

895
00:52:00,074 --> 00:52:01,075
[Fogel]  Yes?

896
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:03,203
[Rodchenkov]  She's getting married.

897
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,121
[Fogel]  Right.

898
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:06,873
[Rodchenkov]  Married, everything.

899
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:10,294
It's time.

900
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:12,254
[Fogel]  Okay.

901
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:14,923
-[Rodchenkov]  Cross fingers now.
-[Fogel]  You, too.

902
00:52:15,006 --> 00:52:16,883
[Rodchenkov]  Remember Orwell.

903
00:52:16,966 --> 00:52:20,554
"We will meet each other
where there is no darkness."

904
00:52:28,853 --> 00:52:31,231
[Fogel]  When I first interviewed you
a year ago,

905
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:33,525
I asked you if you thought
your investigation

906
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:36,194
would be a defining moment
in the history of sport.

907
00:52:37,028 --> 00:52:38,947
How would you answer that question now?

908
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:43,451
Yes, it can be a defining moment,
and I think it should.

909
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:49,249
You've got your number one
Olympic sport in the crosshairs,

910
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:53,628
and you've got one of the major
Olympic countries in the world

911
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:54,671
in the crosshairs,

912
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:57,674
even if it's the crosshairs
only on athletics at the moment.

913
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:02,429
That has the potential of affecting
the credibility of all sport

914
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:06,808
and, therefore,
the continued viability of all sport.

915
00:53:06,891 --> 00:53:09,478
Why would I watch an event that's fixed?

916
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:22,156
[indistinct announcement over PA]

917
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:46,890
[Fogel] There he is.

918
00:53:51,936 --> 00:53:53,938
-I'm here, yes!
-He's escaped.

919
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:56,775
-This is-- Yes. Escaped alive.
-[chuckles]

920
00:53:56,858 --> 00:53:57,859
Come on.

921
00:53:58,693 --> 00:54:00,111
[laughing]

922
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:02,656
[Fogel]  Then you did what?

923
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:04,783
[Rodchenkov]  Destroyed my computer
from my working place.

924
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:07,952
I took hard disk.
And also, I have three copies.

925
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:10,455
It's a historical moment.

926
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:12,541
[Dan Cogan on phone]
Grigory, I want you to know

927
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:15,043
that I understand your desire
to be visible

928
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:18,755
and I think that's very important
for you, to be safe.

929
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:23,552
I was on the phone yesterday
with the lawyer for Edward Snowden.

930
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:26,305
They have some recommendations.

931
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:30,266
I have everything with me,
and also I destroyed my office computer.

932
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:34,521
Put it in a very safe place
and dropped there like a dummy.

933
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:37,565
[Cogan]  We'll talk in a few hours.

934
00:54:43,738 --> 00:54:46,574
-[Fogel] This is, uh... This is it.
-[Rodchenkov] Uh-huh.

935
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:50,161
It's like a labyrinth.

936
00:54:50,244 --> 00:54:51,621
[Fogel] Yeah.

937
00:54:59,338 --> 00:55:01,965
Okay, this is the place.

938
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:03,633
-[Rodchenkov] Good.
-Here's, um...

939
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:06,052
bed, bathroom.

940
00:55:06,135 --> 00:55:07,387
[Rodchenkov] Secure place.

941
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:10,098
It's a good thing.

942
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:12,976
[Fogel] This'll work, at least till we get
what the plan is

943
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:14,060
and what we're gonna do.

944
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:17,230
[Rodchenkov] He goes to me.
He remembers me since May.

945
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:19,358
You will be learning Russian.

946
00:55:20,024 --> 00:55:22,861
You will be learning Russian very soon.

947
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:24,320
I'm missing dogs.

948
00:55:27,281 --> 00:55:32,746
There was one thing
that I noticed in the IC report,

949
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:37,584
and that was that there were KGB people
hanging around the lab.

950
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:40,754
And that's a real no-no.

951
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:44,215
You know, KGB people are not nice people.

952
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:48,052
So I am at home.

953
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:51,473
[interpreter]  We will banish all those
who have a suspicious reputation

954
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:53,349
from the leadership of Russian athletics.

955
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:58,605
In 60 days, we will present
the renewed athletics with new people...

956
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:02,358
[Fogel]  So, if the KGB...
I guess they're called the FSB now...

957
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:05,737
they're in the lab,

958
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:09,741
who else could finance them
but Vitaly Mutko?

959
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:14,203
Oh, I don't think Vitaly Mutko
finances the FSB.

960
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:18,041
-That's a state security operation.
-But... but Putin?

961
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:24,130
Well, whoever finances it
and runs the state security apparatus,

962
00:56:24,213 --> 00:56:27,008
it's not the sport minister.

963
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:32,639
[man]  Officials are essentially saying,
"There may be some problems,

964
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:35,725
but we are trying
and have already taken steps

965
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:37,268
to address those problems."

966
00:56:37,351 --> 00:56:41,105
And all of the officials
are essentially rejecting the idea

967
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:43,357
that there's still a major problem.

968
00:56:43,442 --> 00:56:44,443
[in Russian] Honey, hi.

969
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:48,447
I am here, far away and in the darkness.

970
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:51,491
You see them all?

971
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:55,745
Wearing fancy suits, ties,
making speeches on TV...

972
00:56:56,370 --> 00:56:58,081
It's all a farce.

973
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:02,836
[in English]  Of course
I was very disappointed

974
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:04,463
when laboratory was closed.

975
00:57:06,297 --> 00:57:10,552
Now reading this IC report,
I am just watching with another's eyes.

976
00:57:18,351 --> 00:57:22,439
I know that I could change the past,
telling the truth.

977
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:30,447
But would you like telling the truth,
you will be annihilated.

978
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:44,127
George Orwell,
I was reading the first in 1989.

979
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:46,170
I was 30.

980
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:50,550
Before that time, in Soviet Union,

981
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:54,428
the book  1984,
it was strictly, strictly prohibited.

982
00:57:58,182 --> 00:58:00,852
For me, it was totally shocking.

983
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:05,189
Especially "ignorance is strength."

984
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:08,151
This is the most powerful thing.

985
00:58:09,193 --> 00:58:11,070
It was my weapon.

986
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:15,909
It gave me definitions,
it gave me coordinates

987
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:17,869
how you can apply to your life.

988
00:58:20,121 --> 00:58:21,498
It's like a road map.

989
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:27,921
"'There are three stages
in your reintegration,' said O'Brien.

990
00:58:28,672 --> 00:58:31,508
'There is learning,
there is understanding,

991
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:33,426
and there is acceptance.

992
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:43,770
It's time for you
to enter upon the first stage.'"

993
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,823
I was thinking that we'd start...

994
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:58,492
I ask you questions,
and you answer "yes" or "no."

995
00:59:00,453 --> 00:59:03,957
Does Russia have a systematic, statewide
doping system in place

996
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,374
to cheat the Olympics?

997
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:06,543
Yes.

998
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:11,047
Were you the mastermind
of a statewide system

999
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:12,715
that cheated the Olympics?

1000
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:15,259
Of course. Yes.

1001
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:20,223
Russia won a total of 73 medals
in the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

1002
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:22,601
How many of those athletes were dirty?

1003
00:59:25,436 --> 00:59:26,312
Thirty.

1004
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:31,610
Russia won 81 total medals in London.
How many of those were dirty?

1005
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:32,694
Oh, even more.

1006
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:35,279
50% is for sure. Let it be 50%.

1007
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:39,826
They were earned using special program.

1008
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:41,703
State-sponsored, of course.

1009
00:59:42,871 --> 00:59:47,166
Was Putin aware of the existence
of a Russian doping system?

1010
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,418
Yes. Aware of my name.

1011
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:53,506
He took me from the prison
for such special affair.

1012
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:56,050
-From prison?
-Yes.

1013
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:58,386
To redeem.

1014
00:59:59,345 --> 01:00:02,015
Okay, let's back up one sec here.

1015
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:05,559
My concern is that it's something
they would use to discredit you.

1016
01:00:05,644 --> 01:00:07,020
Oh, of course.

1017
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:12,066
So, the first criminal investigation
against you,

1018
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:13,985
when was it and what happened?

1019
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:20,408
Oh, it's not easy to say how it happened.

1020
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:26,831
Before 2008, China was
the biggest producer of anabolics.

1021
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:30,126
It was produced in a pharmaceutical,

1022
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:32,796
well-equipped,
good manufacturing practice.

1023
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:35,298
No contamination, high qualities.

1024
01:00:35,381 --> 01:00:38,843
And all these anabolics are coming
to Europe, to the United States.

1025
01:00:39,593 --> 01:00:41,387
It's the same like in Russia.

1026
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:45,141
Of course, at that time in Russia,
as the head of laboratory,

1027
01:00:46,267 --> 01:00:47,644
I was a part of system.

1028
01:00:48,477 --> 01:00:52,315
There are three or four
top-level witch doctors,

1029
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:54,067
like Portugalov.

1030
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:58,112
Portugalov was the famous anabolic coach
of Russian national team.

1031
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:01,615
It was Soviet time. He was before me.

1032
01:01:03,827 --> 01:01:06,245
Portugalov is conveyor of athletes.

1033
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:11,417
He has his own protocols,
and he really had great success.

1034
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:15,379
And then they became Olympic champions.

1035
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:21,344
The problem began in 2008.

1036
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:24,848
Jacques Rogge,
the president of the Olympics,

1037
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:27,058
told government of China,

1038
01:01:27,141 --> 01:01:32,063
"You are Olympic country,
but you are producing anabolics in bulk.

1039
01:01:32,146 --> 01:01:35,233
You cannot do like this anymore. Stop it."

1040
01:01:35,316 --> 01:01:37,694
They stop it. Officially.

1041
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:41,072
But who is supplying steroids
to national team?

1042
01:01:41,155 --> 01:01:43,742
Before, there was not any concern.

1043
01:01:43,825 --> 01:01:46,285
You buy stanozolol, it's stanozolol.

1044
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:48,705
But Portugalov was so confident,

1045
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:52,583
offering and providing things
which were not proven or tested.

1046
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:57,005
They have impurities
which could be detectable.

1047
01:01:58,506 --> 01:02:01,760
"Oh," Portugalov say. "What to do?
I spent so much money for this.

1048
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:03,762
Maybe you could advise to do?"

1049
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:06,680
What advice? Drop it to the trash.

1050
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,142
Now, in Moscow laboratory,

1051
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:12,270
we had the best sensitivity
and detection limits.

1052
01:02:12,353 --> 01:02:16,232
I'm very proud that I created the test
for long term metabolites,

1053
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:18,442
which caused the detection window

1054
01:02:18,526 --> 01:02:21,237
to enlarge from two or three weeks
to six months.

1055
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:26,034
That's why Portugalov suddenly had
so many positives.

1056
01:02:27,451 --> 01:02:29,913
All people on the national team,

1057
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:32,957
they came to ask
where to get these steroids.

1058
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:37,295
I knew one source.

1059
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:42,591
Suddenly, I was coordinating
the whole steroid program.

1060
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:45,136
[Fogel]  So you were
cutting out Portugalov?

1061
01:02:45,219 --> 01:02:46,971
[Rodchenkov]  Yes, but what I was doing,

1062
01:02:47,055 --> 01:02:52,852
I was saving national team
from purchasing dirty steroids.

1063
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:59,025
Eventually, I don't know
whether it was by purpose,

1064
01:02:59,525 --> 01:03:02,236
I fight with Portugalov.

1065
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:05,573
Then I became enemy.

1066
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:11,162
Criminal narcotic police came to my home,
they took my computer,

1067
01:03:11,245 --> 01:03:15,041
and they said,
"Then we arrest you on Monday."

1068
01:03:19,087 --> 01:03:23,174
I was in such depression
and my will was paralyzed.

1069
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:29,097
And I decided to escape, I don't know how.

1070
01:03:30,556 --> 01:03:32,683
I took some knife from...

1071
01:03:32,766 --> 01:03:35,269
very, very sharp...
from my wife's kitchen.

1072
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:38,940
I drank whiskey, I sit to the bath.

1073
01:03:40,274 --> 01:03:41,525
And...

1074
01:03:43,736 --> 01:03:46,072
And... it was...

1075
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:47,824
It goes so smooth.

1076
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:52,912
Then, in the water,
I see how blood is doing like this.

1077
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:58,709
It wasn't very strong, the lock.

1078
01:03:59,752 --> 01:04:01,087
My wife opened door.

1079
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:03,172
[siren wailing]

1080
01:04:10,596 --> 01:04:12,806
My heart was seared.

1081
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:16,895
It was very good surgeon.

1082
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:22,066
And since I was considered
to be suicide...

1083
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:26,404
I was sent to a psychiatric clinic.

1084
01:04:27,613 --> 01:04:29,908
After seeing that I am depressed,

1085
01:04:30,574 --> 01:04:33,661
they started to give me such crazy drugs.

1086
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:39,417
I was totally out of reality.

1087
01:04:50,636 --> 01:04:52,430
And then again, something happened.

1088
01:04:53,847 --> 01:04:54,848
The criminal police,

1089
01:04:54,933 --> 01:04:57,851
they sentence me
to another psychiatric clinic...

1090
01:04:59,645 --> 01:05:01,480
which is for those who are sadist,

1091
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:04,233
who are totally
worst-of-the-worst criminals.

1092
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:10,323
They respected me very much.
[chuckles]  I was called "professor."

1093
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:12,325
But I get better, better, better.

1094
01:05:13,117 --> 01:05:16,370
The most funny thing,
they allowed me to use computer,

1095
01:05:16,454 --> 01:05:21,084
so I was working in psychiatric clinic
like a head of laboratory director,

1096
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:23,752
advising the whole Russian national team.

1097
01:05:25,213 --> 01:05:26,380
That time,

1098
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:30,093
I received, from Olympic Committee,
an invitation to London,

1099
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:33,262
2012 Olympic Games, being the director.

1100
01:05:34,555 --> 01:05:39,018
Russian ministry was little bit uncertain
that I'm criminal in full.

1101
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:43,940
But WADA said,

1102
01:05:44,023 --> 01:05:48,277
"If not Rodchenkov, we don't see
in Russia any other candidate than him.

1103
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:52,156
If you don't send him to London,
we send to London another director."

1104
01:05:52,781 --> 01:05:54,158
You can imagine how important

1105
01:05:54,242 --> 01:05:58,829
information from London laboratory is
for national team.

1106
01:05:59,413 --> 01:06:03,001
I had information, what testing
this London laboratory is doing,

1107
01:06:03,084 --> 01:06:06,587
to understand where we are
and how much is danger.

1108
01:06:07,171 --> 01:06:11,175
Without this, all Russian doping situation
will be collapsed.

1109
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:15,763
Thanks to God, Mutko understood this.

1110
01:06:16,889 --> 01:06:19,683
I received a call
from the Moscow investigators.

1111
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:20,601
"Grigory...

1112
01:06:22,019 --> 01:06:23,562
your case is dropped."

1113
01:06:25,106 --> 01:06:27,150
Who took care of it?
Who got the charges dropped?

1114
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:29,027
Putin. Of course.

1115
01:06:29,527 --> 01:06:33,990
It's my redemption. Success in Sochi
instead of being in prison.

1116
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:45,001
[in Russian] We are two workers,
Kamaev and Rodchenkov,

1117
01:06:45,084 --> 01:06:47,336
with a mission in mind...

1118
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,505
This is not a mission.
This is a revolution.

1119
01:06:49,588 --> 01:06:52,466
-This is an anti-WADA strategy.
-Of course! Of course!

1120
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:59,057
[woman]  The former head of Russia's
anti-doping agency RUSADA

1121
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:01,267
has unexpectedly died.

1122
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:07,981
Nikita Kamaev's death comes just
two months after he resigned his post,

1123
01:07:08,066 --> 01:07:11,694
which is, obviously, following
the doping scandal that has rocked Russia

1124
01:07:11,777 --> 01:07:14,196
-and the rest of the world in athletics.
-[sighs]

1125
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:19,202
No, no, no.

1126
01:07:19,993 --> 01:07:24,207
No, no, no.

1127
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:25,749
I have to see.

1128
01:07:26,459 --> 01:07:27,418
[man]  We're told by RUSADA,

1129
01:07:27,501 --> 01:07:30,379
which is the doping agency
he was formerly the head of,

1130
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:33,924
that he appears to have had
a massive heart attack.

1131
01:07:34,007 --> 01:07:35,093
[Rodchenkov] Of course.

1132
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:39,472
Bryan?

1133
01:07:40,264 --> 01:07:41,265
I'm here.

1134
01:07:41,849 --> 01:07:43,016
You know, my friend?

1135
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:46,145
My friend...

1136
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:48,106
died.

1137
01:07:48,939 --> 01:07:50,316
I show you.

1138
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:52,901
[man]  He's got no previous history
of heart problems.

1139
01:07:52,985 --> 01:07:54,695
[Rodchenkov speaking Russian]

1140
01:07:54,778 --> 01:07:57,948
It means, "Grigory, Nikita died."

1141
01:07:58,031 --> 01:08:01,285
[man]  He just died.
And so, it's an enormous shock.

1142
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:04,747
[Rodchenkov]  He's my friend
since school time,

1143
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:08,041
and he never complained about his heart

1144
01:08:08,126 --> 01:08:10,753
or any health problem, and...

1145
01:08:11,712 --> 01:08:14,090
He had a young wife.

1146
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:17,676
They dreamed about children.
I was talking to him day before.

1147
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:19,928
This is...

1148
01:08:20,012 --> 01:08:21,847
Still, I cannot understand.

1149
01:08:23,724 --> 01:08:25,143
It cannot be like this.

1150
01:08:27,228 --> 01:08:29,021
He wrote book.

1151
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:33,567
It's dangerous to write book in Russia.

1152
01:08:35,236 --> 01:08:37,988
[Fogel] I don't know.
We gotta figure this out, because...

1153
01:08:38,071 --> 01:08:39,698
Of course, of course.

1154
01:08:40,824 --> 01:08:43,327
Do you think that they would...

1155
01:08:43,911 --> 01:08:49,250
Bryan, we are playing the most danger game
in the history of sport.

1156
01:08:49,833 --> 01:08:55,047
WADA, ready to pay everything
for me and for you to disappear.

1157
01:08:56,590 --> 01:09:01,053
Because we destroy not only their future,
we destroy their past.

1158
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:05,766
You know, there is very bad man
still not mentioned.

1159
01:09:05,849 --> 01:09:08,644
Deputy Minister Mutko.

1160
01:09:09,687 --> 01:09:12,064
He could kill everybody.

1161
01:09:13,106 --> 01:09:14,483
He's a KGB man.

1162
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:19,363
He's very dangerous.
He has no moral at all. No, no.

1163
01:09:20,364 --> 01:09:22,700
"Oh, Nikita is writing book?

1164
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:26,454
Fifty-two. Oh, he's tired.

1165
01:09:27,538 --> 01:09:28,747
He's desperate.

1166
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:32,710
Oh, please, prepare obituary
for the next week."

1167
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:36,714
Can you imagine? I can imagine easily.

1168
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:43,846
We should be very much careful.

1169
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:49,018
[Fogel]  Who were you reporting to?

1170
01:09:51,395 --> 01:09:53,689
Yuri Nagornykh, vice minister.

1171
01:09:56,484 --> 01:09:59,320
He was practically involved
in everyday routine.

1172
01:10:00,363 --> 01:10:03,073
-[Fogel]  So you would report to Yuri?
-[Rodchenkov]  Yes.

1173
01:10:03,156 --> 01:10:05,117
-[Fogel]  Yuri would report to Mutko?
-[Rodchenkov]  Yes.

1174
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:07,745
-[Fogel]  And Mutko reported to Putin?
-[Rodchenkov]  To Putin, yes.

1175
01:10:12,416 --> 01:10:15,503
[Rodchenkov]  You know, there is no rest
if you are paranoid.

1176
01:10:15,586 --> 01:10:18,214
[Fogel]  It was around 12:30,
one o'clock at night?

1177
01:10:18,589 --> 01:10:21,467
[Rodchenkov]  Or two. I don't know.

1178
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:23,927
They were just hanging around, so...

1179
01:10:24,011 --> 01:10:27,514
-[Fogel]  Somebody in the courtyard?
-[Rodchenkov]  Yes.

1180
01:10:28,849 --> 01:10:34,187
Two strong men knocked my door
and appeared from darkness.

1181
01:10:35,022 --> 01:10:38,359
They asked me to let them in,
and they came here.

1182
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:44,531
And we were talking about sport,
about many relevant or auxiliary things.

1183
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:48,702
They knew about death of Nikita Kamaev.

1184
01:10:50,037 --> 01:10:54,583
About, first of all,
my boss, Minister Mutko.

1185
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:58,629
It was inspection and... [mutters]

1186
01:10:58,712 --> 01:11:00,631
exhausts my nerves...

1187
01:11:00,714 --> 01:11:03,759
They finally gave me subpoena.

1188
01:11:03,842 --> 01:11:06,219
United States district court.

1189
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:09,932
You see, it's for me.
"To Grigory Rodchenkov."

1190
01:11:10,808 --> 01:11:14,853
[Fogel] You're commanded to appear
in front of the grand jury.

1191
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:26,407
[Ed Stier]  He had been approached
by two FBI agents.

1192
01:11:28,909 --> 01:11:31,287
They want him to go to New York

1193
01:11:32,204 --> 01:11:36,959
and appear in a grand jury
and provide his information.

1194
01:11:38,168 --> 01:11:41,797
It triggered a whole series of decisions
that had to be made.

1195
01:11:43,841 --> 01:11:45,884
I've checked out these two guys,

1196
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:50,764
and both of these guys
are not your everyday agent.

1197
01:11:50,848 --> 01:11:52,516
[Cogan] But why did they come to him?

1198
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,852
They want him for something else
that they're doing.

1199
01:11:54,935 --> 01:11:56,395
They didn't come to him for himself.

1200
01:11:57,313 --> 01:11:59,565
They're trying to make a case,

1201
01:11:59,648 --> 01:12:01,525
and they found out he was in LA.

1202
01:12:02,192 --> 01:12:06,238
His boss, Mutko, was actually the guy.

1203
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:07,906
[lawyer] How was he able to survive?

1204
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:11,243
Because he's Putin's best friend.
He's the head of the sports ministry.

1205
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:15,247
Just what sort of, uh... crime...

1206
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:19,501
like, example, I could be done against
or under US legislature?

1207
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:23,839
The United States Justice Department loves
to charge broad conspiracies.

1208
01:12:23,922 --> 01:12:26,425
That's their favorite charging instrument.

1209
01:12:26,509 --> 01:12:30,095
That you conspired
with Mutko and others to--

1210
01:12:30,178 --> 01:12:33,891
What is the conspiracy?
It was conspiracy since 1980.

1211
01:12:33,974 --> 01:12:35,643
Let's reconsider Moscow Olympic Games,

1212
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:39,187
and then reconsider situation
in United States in 1984.

1213
01:12:39,271 --> 01:12:41,231
[lawyer] That's right.

1214
01:12:41,315 --> 01:12:46,070
They're looking for him to plea
to what's called a cooperation agreement.

1215
01:12:46,153 --> 01:12:48,864
What happens is, he cooperates,
and at the end of the day,

1216
01:12:48,947 --> 01:12:52,451
the judge generally
wouldn't incarcerate him, most likely.

1217
01:12:52,535 --> 01:12:55,162
[Stier] First of all,
we don't know whether that's...

1218
01:12:55,245 --> 01:12:57,581
what the bureau's interested in
at this point.

1219
01:12:57,665 --> 01:13:00,959
[lawyer] If we turn down,
they could indict him.

1220
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:03,629
-[Fogel] You gotta be shitting me.
-We can talk to these guys.

1221
01:13:05,631 --> 01:13:08,884
[Stier] The most important thing
is he is not sent back to Russia,

1222
01:13:08,967 --> 01:13:11,387
where he would certainly be assassinated.

1223
01:13:12,513 --> 01:13:14,473
[Fogel] We've been discussing with Grigory

1224
01:13:14,557 --> 01:13:17,142
whether or not he should go public
in some way

1225
01:13:17,225 --> 01:13:18,394
prior to the Olympics.

1226
01:13:18,477 --> 01:13:20,479
[Stier] Prior to the Olympics.
What you're saying is

1227
01:13:20,563 --> 01:13:22,981
if he's established
as a cooperating witness,

1228
01:13:23,065 --> 01:13:24,357
he may not be able to do that.

1229
01:13:24,442 --> 01:13:27,027
[lawyer] That's right. That's right.
Which is a downside.

1230
01:13:27,110 --> 01:13:30,113
[Stier] But once Grigory's public,
I think he's in much less danger.

1231
01:13:30,197 --> 01:13:32,199
Because if the Russians do anything
to hurt him,

1232
01:13:32,282 --> 01:13:33,576
it makes them look very guilty.

1233
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:36,286
[lawyer] Except they'll just say
he had a heart attack, like they did...

1234
01:13:36,369 --> 01:13:38,288
[Fogel] Grigory, look at me.

1235
01:13:39,164 --> 01:13:43,461
Is it in your best interest
to break the story?

1236
01:13:44,294 --> 01:13:45,546
Uh...

1237
01:13:45,629 --> 01:13:48,256
You mean to disclose? We have to disclose.

1238
01:13:49,758 --> 01:13:53,386
[automated voice]  Please enter
your participant ID. Thank you.

1239
01:13:56,849 --> 01:14:01,103
[Rodchenkov]  I strongly suggest
they stay only with list of 36 athletes.

1240
01:14:01,186 --> 01:14:02,980
[Fogel]  Okay.
But they're about to publish.

1241
01:14:03,063 --> 01:14:06,484
They're asking us how they can verify
the authenticity of the Sochi list.

1242
01:14:06,567 --> 01:14:09,319
[Rodchenkov]  Yes, this is most important.
It's authentic document.

1243
01:14:09,402 --> 01:14:11,530
It was in Sochi on my table.

1244
01:14:11,614 --> 01:14:15,075
And if you go behind this list,
there is creation date.

1245
01:14:15,158 --> 01:14:17,077
[Fogel]  And this list came
from the ministry?

1246
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:18,704
[Rodchenkov]  Of course, of course.

1247
01:14:18,787 --> 01:14:20,372
[Fogel]  So, Rebecca, you have the file.

1248
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:23,959
So under properties of the file,
you can see it was created

1249
01:14:24,042 --> 01:14:27,129
Tuesday, January 21st, from the ministry.

1250
01:15:00,538 --> 01:15:03,916
[Fogel] Oh, my God! You're unrecognizable!

1251
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:05,208
Not recognizable at all.

1252
01:15:06,293 --> 01:15:09,087
Psychological, looking in mirror,
it's not me.

1253
01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:11,840
The   New York Times  is breaking tomorrow.

1254
01:15:11,924 --> 01:15:13,759
-Tomorrow?
-Tomorrow.

1255
01:15:13,842 --> 01:15:16,178
Oh, I need... I need... [sighs]

1256
01:15:16,595 --> 01:15:18,055
intravenous injections

1257
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:20,641
-to relax. Tomorrow?
-Tomorrow.

1258
01:15:20,724 --> 01:15:23,268
-[Rodchenkov] Why not?
-Okay, so here's what's happening.

1259
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:27,480
[Fogel]  Have you spoke
to the Department of Justice yet?

1260
01:15:27,565 --> 01:15:29,274
[lawyer on phone]  I told them,

1261
01:15:29,357 --> 01:15:31,359
and they reacted
like I expected they would.

1262
01:15:31,443 --> 01:15:32,444
They're upset.

1263
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:33,571
-Right.
-So...

1264
01:15:33,654 --> 01:15:36,574
They wanted to know,
did he provide any documents to them?

1265
01:15:37,157 --> 01:15:41,203
[Fogel] He provided lists
of doped athletes.

1266
01:15:41,704 --> 01:15:47,668
He provided an FSB file
of how the testing was arranged at Sochi.

1267
01:15:47,751 --> 01:15:51,797
Yeah, unfortunately,
they're gonna terminate the whole...

1268
01:15:53,090 --> 01:15:56,384
Now that he turned over documents,
they're gonna cancel.

1269
01:15:56,927 --> 01:15:58,845
And they're just gonna prosecute him.

1270
01:16:04,392 --> 01:16:07,520
[Rodchenkov]  "It's time for you
to enter upon the second stage."

1271
01:16:11,399 --> 01:16:13,526
[Jacques Rogge]
The International Olympic Committee

1272
01:16:13,610 --> 01:16:15,112
has the honor of announcing

1273
01:16:15,195 --> 01:16:19,575
that the 22nd Olympic Winter Games in 2014

1274
01:16:19,658 --> 01:16:22,202
are awarded to the city of Sochi.

1275
01:16:22,285 --> 01:16:23,746
[cheering]

1276
01:16:25,873 --> 01:16:30,210
That's future for everything.
That's future for my country! For Russia!

1277
01:16:31,795 --> 01:16:35,507
Millions of citizens of Russia are united
by the Olympic dream.

1278
01:16:36,383 --> 01:16:41,138
Our national pledge to you is,
the choice of Sochi is the best choice.

1279
01:16:43,724 --> 01:16:47,019
[Rodchenkov]
There is a top-level decision.

1280
01:16:47,102 --> 01:16:48,270
You know who I mean.

1281
01:16:48,854 --> 01:16:52,482
And big boss, Vladimir Putin, saying,

1282
01:16:52,565 --> 01:16:56,779
"We have to show the best result in Sochi.

1283
01:16:56,862 --> 01:16:59,072
We must show the others who we are."

1284
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:03,285
-[man]  Hurrah!
-[crowd]  Hurrah!

1285
01:17:04,577 --> 01:17:06,914
Hurrah!

1286
01:17:06,997 --> 01:17:11,001
[Rodchenkov]  We could make team clean
before Sochi. One month.

1287
01:17:11,084 --> 01:17:12,460
[crowd cheering]

1288
01:17:16,089 --> 01:17:21,178
But it was decided
to use PEDs during Sochi.

1289
01:17:22,721 --> 01:17:26,391
Through the competition
so they could be at their very top level?

1290
01:17:26,474 --> 01:17:27,392
Right, right.

1291
01:17:28,518 --> 01:17:30,062
[announcer] Vladimir Putin.

1292
01:17:30,145 --> 01:17:31,604
[announcer speaking French]

1293
01:17:31,688 --> 01:17:34,524
[Fogel] So instead of using the science,

1294
01:17:34,983 --> 01:17:38,236
the science that you developed
to get around the system,

1295
01:17:39,362 --> 01:17:40,739
you abandoned the science?

1296
01:17:40,823 --> 01:17:41,824
Yes.

1297
01:17:42,825 --> 01:17:45,327
The most important "yes."
Forget about this.

1298
01:17:46,203 --> 01:17:47,663
Ladies and gentlemen,

1299
01:17:47,746 --> 01:17:54,336
let me declare the 126th session
of the International Olympic Committee

1300
01:17:54,419 --> 01:17:55,671
open.

1301
01:17:55,754 --> 01:17:58,548
-Thank you.
-[audience applauding]

1302
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:10,352
[Rodchenkov]  Opening ceremony was
the most heartbreaking day...

1303
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:13,731
in sports history.

1304
01:18:21,864 --> 01:18:24,783
-Hi, Bryan.
- The story just broke.

1305
01:18:24,867 --> 01:18:28,829
[stammering] What do you mean?
Is it published or not?

1306
01:18:28,912 --> 01:18:30,622
-Yes, published.
-[gasps]

1307
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:32,624
Published! The story is published!

1308
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:36,503
[man on TV]  According
to  The New York Times,  Rodchenkov...

1309
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:38,130
Okay.

1310
01:18:40,257 --> 01:18:42,300
This is the photo of bottles.

1311
01:18:42,384 --> 01:18:45,470
Those bottles were given
from Nikita Kamaev.

1312
01:18:46,096 --> 01:18:48,556
"Grigory Rodchenkov,
who ran the laboratory

1313
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:51,101
that handled testing
for thousands of Olympians,

1314
01:18:51,184 --> 01:18:54,604
said he developed a three-drug cocktail
of banned substances

1315
01:18:54,687 --> 01:18:58,233
that he mixed with liquor and provided
to dozens of Russian athletes,

1316
01:18:58,316 --> 01:19:01,194
helping to facilitate
one of the most elaborate

1317
01:19:01,278 --> 01:19:04,865
and successful doping ploys
in sport history."

1318
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:07,659
[sighs deeply]

1319
01:19:10,203 --> 01:19:13,791
[Thomas Bach]  Join and support
our fight for fair play.

1320
01:19:14,541 --> 01:19:16,459
The athletes deserve it.

1321
01:19:18,045 --> 01:19:22,299
And to you, my fellow Olympic athletes,

1322
01:19:22,382 --> 01:19:28,013
I say, respect the rules,
play fair, be clean.

1323
01:19:28,096 --> 01:19:29,681
[crowd cheering]

1324
01:19:32,225 --> 01:19:33,894
[Fogel]  In 2014, in Sochi,

1325
01:19:34,477 --> 01:19:39,942
did Russia swap out dirty urine
for clean urine?

1326
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:42,027
Always.

1327
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:47,699
[dramatic music playing]

1328
01:19:53,205 --> 01:19:56,083
[narrator]  The information contained
in this little bottle

1329
01:19:56,166 --> 01:19:59,086
helps keep sport
on the level playing field.

1330
01:19:59,169 --> 01:20:01,254
That's why we created ADAMS,

1331
01:20:01,338 --> 01:20:05,217
the free Anti-Doping Administration
and Management System from WADA.

1332
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:10,222
All operating under a level of security
typically used by financial institutions.

1333
01:20:10,305 --> 01:20:12,850
In effect,
becoming the centralized clearing house

1334
01:20:12,933 --> 01:20:14,810
for all anti-doping information.

1335
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:18,771
ADAMS. Everyone should play true.

1336
01:20:22,525 --> 01:20:25,362
[Fogel]  Walk us through
the collection process.

1337
01:20:25,445 --> 01:20:29,366
[Dick Pound]  The sample is provided
in front of a doping control officer.

1338
01:20:29,449 --> 01:20:31,910
It's in this container.
It's divided into two.

1339
01:20:32,702 --> 01:20:35,831
[Fogel]  The A sample and the B sample.
These are the...

1340
01:20:35,914 --> 01:20:37,874
-[Catlin]  Bottles.
-[Fogel]  They're called the Bereg-Kits?

1341
01:20:37,958 --> 01:20:42,128
Yes. It's one particular company
in Switzerland that makes them.

1342
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:44,631
[McLaren]  It's called
the Berlinger bottle,

1343
01:20:44,714 --> 01:20:47,300
and the Berlinger bottle is
state of the art.

1344
01:20:47,384 --> 01:20:51,471
It's sealed very tight
with a vice-like device.

1345
01:20:51,554 --> 01:20:54,182
A collector is right there, watching.

1346
01:20:57,269 --> 01:20:58,728
And then it goes to the lab.

1347
01:21:00,981 --> 01:21:05,818
It's in the lab that the B bottles are
pulled aside and put in the freezer.

1348
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:11,449
The analytical work is done
on the A sample.

1349
01:21:12,993 --> 01:21:14,369
[Olivier Rabin]  The way we collect
the sample,

1350
01:21:14,452 --> 01:21:16,371
the trustability of the sample,

1351
01:21:16,454 --> 01:21:18,498
the fact that we've got
an A and a B sample

1352
01:21:18,581 --> 01:21:21,626
is a very, very, uh, safe system.

1353
01:21:22,460 --> 01:21:24,546
[McLaren]  The caps on the bottles,

1354
01:21:24,629 --> 01:21:28,800
they're designed in such a way that
they need to be destroyed to be taken off.

1355
01:21:28,884 --> 01:21:33,096
[Catlin]  In the lab, they have a device
that cracks open the A sample.

1356
01:21:34,222 --> 01:21:36,058
It's the only way you can get it off.

1357
01:21:37,184 --> 01:21:42,064
[Pound]  If an A sample tests positive,
then the B gets analyzed.

1358
01:21:42,689 --> 01:21:44,566
The B has to confirm the A.

1359
01:21:45,317 --> 01:21:48,069
That's this enormous protection.

1360
01:21:49,612 --> 01:21:52,324
[Rodchenkov]  From Nagornykh,
in preparation to Sochi,

1361
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:58,705
it was strict order to develop procedure
how we can have new bottles,

1362
01:21:58,788 --> 01:22:00,582
new caps or open cap.

1363
01:22:01,666 --> 01:22:04,044
And this FSB officer,

1364
01:22:04,127 --> 01:22:09,549
he was responsible for the day
when I gave closed Bereg-Kit,

1365
01:22:09,632 --> 01:22:12,385
and after half an hour,
I receive it opened.

1366
01:22:12,469 --> 01:22:13,511
And the...

1367
01:22:14,429 --> 01:22:17,515
cap and the bottle are the same.

1368
01:22:17,599 --> 01:22:19,226
And I can... [imitates pouring]

1369
01:22:19,309 --> 01:22:22,729
a little bit rinse
and then pour and close.

1370
01:22:22,812 --> 01:22:24,272
[imitates lid locking]

1371
01:22:24,356 --> 01:22:25,648
Like Bereg-Kit.

1372
01:22:26,358 --> 01:22:28,276
It's unbelievable how they could do this.

1373
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:36,326
This was named Operation Sochi Resultat.

1374
01:22:37,452 --> 01:22:41,039
In Russian,  "resultat"  means
"to achieve positive results."

1375
01:22:42,665 --> 01:22:44,251
[Fogel]  So, you need clean urines?

1376
01:22:44,334 --> 01:22:46,962
[Rodchenkov]  I need clean urines
for each candidate.

1377
01:22:47,045 --> 01:22:52,384
[Fogel]  For every single Russian athlete
under the state-sponsored doping,

1378
01:22:53,051 --> 01:22:57,930
you had clean samples
of their urine being held?

1379
01:22:58,015 --> 01:22:59,349
Yes.

1380
01:22:59,432 --> 01:23:04,146
[Fogel]  If an athlete needed
to be swapped, you could swap 'em.

1381
01:23:04,229 --> 01:23:05,063
[Rodchenkov]  Yes.

1382
01:23:05,147 --> 01:23:11,069
But in Sochi, because of the Olympics,
I am under double control.

1383
01:23:11,153 --> 01:23:14,614
Both from IOC, WADA and I don't know who.

1384
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:19,244
Level of security is stunning.
It's unbelievable.

1385
01:23:21,204 --> 01:23:23,206
[Rabin]  There was a delegation
of foreign scientists

1386
01:23:23,290 --> 01:23:25,042
who were embedded in the laboratory.

1387
01:23:25,125 --> 01:23:28,003
So, if there were substitutions,
manipulations,

1388
01:23:28,086 --> 01:23:30,755
these people would've been
in the front line to observe this.

1389
01:23:32,632 --> 01:23:34,967
In Sochi, laboratory was like this.

1390
01:23:35,635 --> 01:23:37,012
It was our entrance,

1391
01:23:37,095 --> 01:23:40,265
but from this behind,
where we have a fire exit,

1392
01:23:40,348 --> 01:23:43,560
there is another building.
It was a KGB building.

1393
01:23:43,643 --> 01:23:46,229
And bank of clean urines were kept here.

1394
01:23:46,313 --> 01:23:49,107
[man]  Coming into the final two heats
of the four-man bobsleigh,

1395
01:23:49,191 --> 01:23:52,777
Pilot Alexander Zubkov
and brakeman Alexey Voevoda...

1396
01:23:52,860 --> 01:23:53,861
[crowd cheering]

1397
01:24:01,203 --> 01:24:02,620
Gold to Russia,

1398
01:24:02,704 --> 01:24:06,583
making their pilot the oldest man ever
to win the four-man bobsleigh.

1399
01:24:07,917 --> 01:24:11,546
[Fogel]  So how many FSB officers
were working at Sochi?

1400
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:13,881
Hundred.

1401
01:24:16,093 --> 01:24:18,345
Throughout the day, our KGB officer

1402
01:24:18,428 --> 01:24:21,973
brought the clean urines
of all our athletes selected for testing

1403
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:25,185
to our secret operational room
in the laboratory.

1404
01:24:25,935 --> 01:24:29,689
Meanwhile, all the urines collected
from the athletes during the day

1405
01:24:29,772 --> 01:24:33,818
were transported to the Olympic village
and held until 1:00 or 2:00 a.m.

1406
01:24:34,736 --> 01:24:36,154
Then I received a call.

1407
01:24:36,237 --> 01:24:39,449
"Grigory, I will be delivering the samples
in 15 minutes."

1408
01:24:40,033 --> 01:24:42,869
Before samples arrived,
it gave me time to make sure

1409
01:24:42,952 --> 01:24:47,624
that there were no WADA or IOC observers
left snooping around the laboratory.

1410
01:24:49,917 --> 01:24:51,836
Once samples were checked in,

1411
01:24:51,919 --> 01:24:54,797
the operation entered
the most dangerous phase.

1412
01:24:55,673 --> 01:24:59,636
When the A and B bottles
were split on to two different carts,

1413
01:24:59,719 --> 01:25:02,764
my assistant wheeled the B bottles
into a storage room

1414
01:25:02,847 --> 01:25:06,684
and slipped the Russian athletes'
B bottles into his lab coat.

1415
01:25:07,519 --> 01:25:11,439
This is highly illegal,
but we need to replace these dirty urines.

1416
01:25:12,232 --> 01:25:14,442
Then he wheeled the cart
with the A bottles

1417
01:25:14,526 --> 01:25:17,154
into the aliquoting room,
as per procedure.

1418
01:25:18,155 --> 01:25:19,822
[Fogel]
'Cause it's supposed to be opened.

1419
01:25:19,906 --> 01:25:22,074
[Rodchenkov]  For all A samples, yes.

1420
01:25:24,911 --> 01:25:28,498
To escape all the video recording,
aliquoting room was like this.

1421
01:25:28,581 --> 01:25:33,420
And our room, we had the hole in it.

1422
01:25:33,503 --> 01:25:36,297
So we take this little bit...

1423
01:25:36,381 --> 01:25:39,008
-How you say this thing? It's--
-Uh...

1424
01:25:39,092 --> 01:25:40,927
Like this, if you have something...

1425
01:25:41,427 --> 01:25:44,556
You take this table out,
and there is a... like a...

1426
01:25:45,098 --> 01:25:50,186
like a power outlet blocked
without any, uh... socket.

1427
01:25:50,270 --> 01:25:52,480
-Okay, right, right.
-But then you take it out.

1428
01:25:52,564 --> 01:25:55,650
So it looks like it's a power outlet
without a socket, but it's not.

1429
01:25:55,733 --> 01:25:57,569
-It's not. It's a hole.
-It's a hole.

1430
01:25:59,028 --> 01:26:02,073
[Rodchenkov]  You're taking both samples
through this hole,

1431
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:04,451
and A samples, we immediately...

1432
01:26:05,034 --> 01:26:06,578
pour away and clean.

1433
01:26:07,329 --> 01:26:08,455
[Fogel]  But the B sample...

1434
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:11,666
[Rodchenkov]  B samples are taken
by KGB and... whew!

1435
01:26:13,042 --> 01:26:16,879
In the darkness,
people coming from the trash/fire exit.

1436
01:26:16,963 --> 01:26:18,756
[imitating footsteps]

1437
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:25,054
Then, after two hours, they came back
with B bottles opened to swap.

1438
01:26:25,805 --> 01:26:28,891
Because, of course,
you have in advance clean urine.

1439
01:26:29,976 --> 01:26:33,813
So, B samples are finished
with the urine swapping.

1440
01:26:33,896 --> 01:26:36,148
Taken by KGB and--

1441
01:26:36,233 --> 01:26:40,737
[Fogel]  Because the B samples are taken
by the IOC and held in long-term storage.

1442
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:41,821
[Rodchenkov]  Yes.

1443
01:26:43,323 --> 01:26:48,160
[Fogel]  If WADA or the IOC retest
those samples, would they be clean?

1444
01:26:48,745 --> 01:26:51,956
[Rodchenkov]
Reanalysis will return negative.

1445
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:55,585
Because, you know,
we are top-level cheaters.

1446
01:26:55,668 --> 01:26:56,711
[chuckles]

1447
01:26:56,794 --> 01:27:00,131
To over-cheat us,
you should be much such experienced.

1448
01:27:00,215 --> 01:27:02,342
But how it comes, such experience?

1449
01:27:02,425 --> 01:27:04,051
[chuckles]

1450
01:27:10,267 --> 01:27:12,184
[Fogel]  If there were
evidence brought forward

1451
01:27:12,269 --> 01:27:14,145
that showed that a country or WADA lab

1452
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:17,857
had found a way
to break into the collection bottles,

1453
01:27:17,940 --> 01:27:22,069
what do you think that would say
about the entire testing system?

1454
01:27:22,153 --> 01:27:26,658
What it would say is that corruption
has gone to the depths of...

1455
01:27:28,618 --> 01:27:32,163
that part of the process,
which would be most disturbing.

1456
01:27:33,122 --> 01:27:34,249
It would be, uh...

1457
01:27:35,583 --> 01:27:42,424
obviously a very serious, serious act
of manipulation from that lab.

1458
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:45,635
It would be done. It wouldn't work.

1459
01:27:45,718 --> 01:27:51,223
If that can be done successfully,
then the testing system is over.

1460
01:27:51,766 --> 01:27:56,187
[Fogel] Does WADA have the ability
to catch drug cheats today?

1461
01:27:58,356 --> 01:27:59,441
No.

1462
01:28:03,110 --> 01:28:05,822
[choir singing Russian national anthem]

1463
01:28:11,619 --> 01:28:14,163
[Rodchenkov]
Because of this whole steroid program,

1464
01:28:14,247 --> 01:28:16,332
I pulled off 13 gold medals.

1465
01:28:16,416 --> 01:28:17,542
It's unbelievable.

1466
01:28:19,252 --> 01:28:21,045
Never before.  [chuckles]

1467
01:28:22,714 --> 01:28:27,259
Everything was made clean,
and Putin was very much happy.

1468
01:28:27,343 --> 01:28:29,887
[anthem continuing]

1469
01:28:44,151 --> 01:28:46,237
[woman]  Russia came out on top
of the medals board,

1470
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:51,451
winning 33 overall,
including an Olympic high of 13 gold.

1471
01:29:04,088 --> 01:29:05,840
[crowd cheering]

1472
01:29:12,972 --> 01:29:18,060
[Rodchenkov]  But immediately after,
he started war against Ukraine.

1473
01:29:23,107 --> 01:29:24,233
[man]  Before the Olympics,

1474
01:29:24,316 --> 01:29:28,488
his popularity rating in Russia
had been falling steadily for years.

1475
01:29:28,571 --> 01:29:31,198
But when the games began, this.

1476
01:29:35,327 --> 01:29:38,831
[Rodchenkov]  I felt my personal guilt
for such event.

1477
01:29:38,915 --> 01:29:44,378
Would Russia had less medals,
Putin would be not such aggressive.

1478
01:29:51,469 --> 01:29:54,514
[man]  What you're about to hear
is not lifted from a Tom Clancy novel,

1479
01:29:54,597 --> 01:29:57,809
nor is it borrowed from
the elegant prose of John le Carré

1480
01:29:57,892 --> 01:30:00,478
or adapted from Robert Ludlum's work.

1481
01:30:00,562 --> 01:30:02,229
But if the protagonist is to be believed,

1482
01:30:02,313 --> 01:30:04,982
this drama is the ultimate handiwork
of Vladimir Putin

1483
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:08,360
and the intelligence successors
to the KGB.

1484
01:30:08,445 --> 01:30:11,823
LA may be a lot safer than Mother Russia,
given the recent...

1485
01:30:11,906 --> 01:30:13,450
-Bryan!
-[Fogel]  Yeah?

1486
01:30:13,950 --> 01:30:17,620
Article is incredible. It's so very good.

1487
01:30:18,204 --> 01:30:20,164
I am shocked. I'm reading twice.

1488
01:30:20,247 --> 01:30:23,084
You know, Russia even cannot breathe.

1489
01:30:23,167 --> 01:30:25,419
They still even don't respond.

1490
01:30:25,503 --> 01:30:28,590
-Of course, there it is, midnight, but--
-[Fogel]  Let me stop you.

1491
01:30:29,131 --> 01:30:32,134
-I just spoke to our lawyer.
-What happened?

1492
01:30:32,218 --> 01:30:35,555
[Fogel]  They're not returning any
of his calls.

1493
01:30:36,806 --> 01:30:37,807
I am arrested?

1494
01:30:38,516 --> 01:30:42,478
[Fogel]  We don't know yet.
We're in a holding pattern.

1495
01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:49,318
I am sitting locked in my home.
I'm a little bit afraid.

1496
01:30:49,401 --> 01:30:51,654
[Fogel]  Let me get this done,
and I'll come by, okay?

1497
01:30:51,738 --> 01:30:52,822
Putin will kill me.

1498
01:30:54,157 --> 01:30:56,659
-[man 1]  Rodchenkov...
- [man 2]  ...allegations...

1499
01:30:56,742 --> 01:30:59,454
[woman]  Dozens of Sochi medal winners
were part of a secret...

1500
01:30:59,537 --> 01:31:00,913
[Rodchenkov] Nine, one, seven.

1501
01:31:01,706 --> 01:31:04,500
[overlapping chatter in Russian]

1502
01:31:04,584 --> 01:31:06,961
[exhales sharply] Okay.

1503
01:31:07,587 --> 01:31:11,007
[man]  He has since fled Russia
because he said he feared for his life.

1504
01:31:11,090 --> 01:31:14,426
[woman]  Russia's sports minister
has dismissed the claims as nonsense,

1505
01:31:14,511 --> 01:31:17,972
adding they were a continuation
of the attack on Russian sport,

1506
01:31:18,055 --> 01:31:20,975
which was backed up
by the deputy sports minister.

1507
01:31:21,058 --> 01:31:24,604
[in Russian] So that this is clear
for everyone...

1508
01:31:24,687 --> 01:31:28,190
there has never been
and there is not any doping program.

1509
01:31:28,274 --> 01:31:32,028
[woman]  Vladimir Putin calls
the claims "the slander of a turncoat."

1510
01:31:34,113 --> 01:31:36,574
[Fogel] We're meeting
with a white-collar attorney

1511
01:31:36,658 --> 01:31:39,368
who has handled a lot of criminal cases.

1512
01:31:39,451 --> 01:31:41,203
[man on phone]  What happened
with his other lawyer?

1513
01:31:41,287 --> 01:31:44,498
[Fogel] His other lawyer,
they have a Moscow office.

1514
01:31:44,582 --> 01:31:51,463
It appears that the firm got cold feet due
to a conflict of interest, they said.

1515
01:31:52,256 --> 01:31:55,009
[man]  Thomas Bach,
who heads the IOC, said,

1516
01:31:55,092 --> 01:31:56,427
"If this is true,

1517
01:31:56,511 --> 01:32:00,014
it is an unimaginable level
of criminality."

1518
01:32:00,181 --> 01:32:03,643
[woman]  The IOC
calling the report "very worrying."

1519
01:32:03,726 --> 01:32:05,645
[man]  "We ask
the World Anti-Doping Agency

1520
01:32:05,728 --> 01:32:07,897
to investigate immediately."

1521
01:32:08,940 --> 01:32:11,192
[man 2]  The Justice Department
is opening an investigation

1522
01:32:11,275 --> 01:32:13,861
into Russian government officials,
athletes, coaches

1523
01:32:13,945 --> 01:32:15,655
and anti-doping authorities.

1524
01:32:23,412 --> 01:32:25,582
[Fogel] This letter was sent by WADA.

1525
01:32:25,665 --> 01:32:29,543
"Dear Grigory, in light of your recent
declarations to  The New York Times,

1526
01:32:29,627 --> 01:32:31,545
we would like to meet to better understand

1527
01:32:31,629 --> 01:32:34,465
the basis of your allegations
and your proposed way forward.

1528
01:32:34,548 --> 01:32:38,094
Sincerely, David Howman
and Olivier Niggli."

1529
01:32:38,845 --> 01:32:42,306
I'm talking tomorrow to another lawyer.

1530
01:32:43,683 --> 01:32:44,684
So...

1531
01:32:45,893 --> 01:32:49,396
He seems credible, but of course,
it's his word against Russia.

1532
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:51,315
[man in Russian]
There were older questions

1533
01:32:51,398 --> 01:32:53,359
regarding Rodchenkov's mental health
in all this,

1534
01:32:53,442 --> 01:32:55,402
as four years ago,
after a failed suicide attempt,

1535
01:32:55,486 --> 01:32:58,322
he was placed into a mental institution,

1536
01:32:58,405 --> 01:33:03,285
the diagnosis described
as the first stages of schizophrenia.

1537
01:33:04,328 --> 01:33:07,915
[Rodchenkov]  What to do with my wife
and children? What they will know?

1538
01:33:07,999 --> 01:33:10,835
Or I just disappear for them?
They'll go crazy.

1539
01:33:11,460 --> 01:33:15,715
[Howman]  Bryan, this is David and Olivier.
We want this meeting to go ahead.

1540
01:33:15,798 --> 01:33:17,592
Can you call us back?

1541
01:33:19,761 --> 01:33:21,638
I'm not ready to answer.

1542
01:33:25,892 --> 01:33:30,062
We need something lucky,
like it's  Alice in Wonderland,

1543
01:33:30,146 --> 01:33:32,732
to rabbit's hole, to sit here.

1544
01:33:32,815 --> 01:33:35,484
-[Fogel] I know.
-[Rodchenkov] To wait until it ends.

1545
01:33:35,568 --> 01:33:38,237
[Fogel] I know. That's why I wanna...
[chuckles]

1546
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:41,323
We're trying to get this...
To make it right.

1547
01:33:41,407 --> 01:33:43,367
[Rodchenkov] But lawyer is trustful?

1548
01:33:43,450 --> 01:33:45,787
-[Fogel] He is a big one.
-[Rodchenkov] He's a big one.

1549
01:33:45,870 --> 01:33:48,080
-[Fogel] Yeah, top of the top of the top.
-[Rodchenkov] Yes.

1550
01:33:48,164 --> 01:33:50,958
[man in Russian]
We are digging deeper into his identity.

1551
01:33:52,043 --> 01:33:55,212
We've obtained
some of his exclusive documents.

1552
01:33:58,716 --> 01:34:00,134
[woman in Russian]
Grigory Rodchenkov

1553
01:34:00,217 --> 01:34:02,178
and American movie director Bryan Fogel,

1554
01:34:02,261 --> 01:34:06,598
they talked many times
via e-mail and wrote...

1555
01:34:07,474 --> 01:34:11,187
[man in Russian]
The FBI are following him closely,

1556
01:34:11,270 --> 01:34:15,399
Grigory Rodchenkov himself mentioned
to his sister in a recent Skype call.

1557
01:34:15,482 --> 01:34:18,235
[Marina in Russian]  Grish,
just sit tight. Don't be too impulsive.

1558
01:34:18,319 --> 01:34:21,447
[Rodchenkov]  No, of course
I will not do anything...

1559
01:34:21,530 --> 01:34:23,282
[Marina]  Of course. Absolutely.

1560
01:34:23,365 --> 01:34:26,327
[Rodchenkov]  ...without the protection
of the FBI.

1561
01:34:28,871 --> 01:34:30,247
[speaking Russian]

1562
01:34:30,331 --> 01:34:32,291
[man speaking Russian]

1563
01:34:32,374 --> 01:34:35,586
[in Russian] I refuse to make any
comments on this. I'm very sorry.

1564
01:34:35,669 --> 01:34:40,091
I'm sure you have very intelligent people
who can explain all this.

1565
01:34:43,385 --> 01:34:46,388
[Rodchenkov in Russian]  Honey, I already
spoke to the children. They're fine.

1566
01:34:46,472 --> 01:34:50,101
[Veronika]  Grisha,
now it's another problem.

1567
01:34:50,184 --> 01:34:51,769
I'm worried about you.

1568
01:34:52,644 --> 01:34:54,605
[Rodchenkov]  I'll take care of this.
Just hold on.

1569
01:34:54,688 --> 01:34:57,524
[Veronika]  This is what I'm worried about.

1570
01:34:57,608 --> 01:35:01,237
They're turning us into the monster now.

1571
01:35:02,863 --> 01:35:04,532
Or trying to.

1572
01:35:04,615 --> 01:35:06,743
[Radchenkov] It's okay.
We'll get through this.

1573
01:35:10,996 --> 01:35:13,374
[Veronika]  What do you want
to come of all this?

1574
01:35:20,381 --> 01:35:22,549
[Rodchenkov in English]
"To the future or to the past,

1575
01:35:25,344 --> 01:35:28,264
to a time when thought is free...

1576
01:35:31,225 --> 01:35:35,104
when truth exists
and what is done cannot be undone."

1577
01:35:38,482 --> 01:35:41,778
[Jim Walden]  What everyone
is interested in is the evidence he has,

1578
01:35:41,861 --> 01:35:44,822
both in terms of the documents
on his computer

1579
01:35:44,905 --> 01:35:48,159
and the cell phone
that he was using at the time.

1580
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:51,913
Two people connected
with the Russian doping program are dead

1581
01:35:51,996 --> 01:35:55,416
under circumstances
that seem highly suspect.

1582
01:35:55,499 --> 01:35:58,002
One of the first things
that I learned from authorities

1583
01:35:58,085 --> 01:35:59,837
when I came onto the case

1584
01:35:59,921 --> 01:36:04,091
was that the Russian government
has the resources and the will.

1585
01:36:04,175 --> 01:36:07,511
So we've had to develop
a very multi-stage protocol

1586
01:36:07,595 --> 01:36:11,348
to minimize the chances our conversations
will be intercepted.

1587
01:36:12,266 --> 01:36:14,768
The main concern
is that they would be able,

1588
01:36:14,852 --> 01:36:18,230
through those communications,
to try to triangulate his location,

1589
01:36:18,314 --> 01:36:23,569
and if they have agents
in the United States, then to do him harm.

1590
01:36:27,489 --> 01:36:29,116
[man]  We're 84 days away

1591
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:31,911
till the Summer Games
in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.

1592
01:36:32,494 --> 01:36:35,998
[woman]  Until now, there's
only been hard evidence about athletics,

1593
01:36:36,082 --> 01:36:39,085
but this is pointing the finger
at a whole range of sports.

1594
01:36:43,797 --> 01:36:47,343
[Fogel] As you know, there's a Department
of Justice investigation going.

1595
01:36:47,426 --> 01:36:50,221
Grigory's been advised by his lawyer

1596
01:36:50,304 --> 01:36:53,515
he should not be here
for security reasons.

1597
01:36:55,226 --> 01:36:58,020
I worked with Grigory
over about six months

1598
01:36:58,104 --> 01:37:02,566
to compile a record
of what happened in Russia.

1599
01:37:03,650 --> 01:37:06,320
This is the spreadsheet
of every single athlete

1600
01:37:06,403 --> 01:37:09,323
that was on the state-mandated protocol.

1601
01:37:10,241 --> 01:37:13,035
What every single athlete was taking
in London,

1602
01:37:13,119 --> 01:37:15,537
including their sample numbers
and collection.

1603
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:19,375
When Christiane goes back
and tests these samples correctly,

1604
01:37:19,458 --> 01:37:21,835
she will basically find them all positive.

1605
01:37:23,379 --> 01:37:26,840
And we have all their protocols
before the London Games.

1606
01:37:29,176 --> 01:37:32,346
We have the same for Beijing.

1607
01:37:33,014 --> 01:37:36,976
And this outlines
how Russia was collecting

1608
01:37:37,059 --> 01:37:40,729
thousands and thousands
of clean samples for swapping.

1609
01:37:40,812 --> 01:37:43,315
No, no, this we saw,
but we want to ask question

1610
01:37:43,399 --> 01:37:46,110
as well as how it was done,
understanding--

1611
01:37:46,193 --> 01:37:51,615
So, sodium chloride is added to the sample
to increase specific gravity.

1612
01:37:51,698 --> 01:37:53,825
Many of these samples are gonna have

1613
01:37:53,910 --> 01:37:58,705
a hundred times the sodium content
that should be in somebody's urine.

1614
01:37:58,789 --> 01:38:00,457
Let me make sure I understand.

1615
01:38:00,541 --> 01:38:04,461
They were taking the B
to be opened secretly?

1616
01:38:04,545 --> 01:38:05,629
Yes.

1617
01:38:05,712 --> 01:38:08,507
You said it was removed
after the Paralympic Games.

1618
01:38:08,590 --> 01:38:11,468
Does it mean that it happened
also for the Paralympic Games?

1619
01:38:11,552 --> 01:38:12,553
Yes, yes.

1620
01:38:12,636 --> 01:38:16,890
Both the Olympic and the Paralympic Games,
they swapped urine.

1621
01:38:17,891 --> 01:38:22,063
Vancouver was really the impetus
for the urine swapping operation.

1622
01:38:22,146 --> 01:38:23,940
They only won a handful of medals,

1623
01:38:24,023 --> 01:38:27,359
and to see to it that
that didn't happen again at Sochi.

1624
01:38:27,901 --> 01:38:29,903
We'll find that out when--

1625
01:38:29,987 --> 01:38:31,488
In terms of time-sensitive,

1626
01:38:31,572 --> 01:38:33,532
London is more sensitive,
in the sense that

1627
01:38:33,615 --> 01:38:35,576
these athletes are going
to the next Rio Games,

1628
01:38:35,659 --> 01:38:36,660
not the winter ones.

1629
01:38:36,743 --> 01:38:39,538
[Fogel] This is Sochi. This is London.
This is Beijing.

1630
01:38:39,621 --> 01:38:42,083
This goes all the way back to 1968.

1631
01:38:42,166 --> 01:38:46,128
There never was anti-doping in Russia.
Period. Ever.

1632
01:38:46,212 --> 01:38:47,671
Across all summer sports?

1633
01:38:47,754 --> 01:38:49,131
Every sport.

1634
01:38:49,631 --> 01:38:50,632
[Christiane Ayotte] He's sorry?

1635
01:38:52,468 --> 01:38:54,095
-Who's that?
-[Ayotte] Grigory.

1636
01:38:54,178 --> 01:38:55,721
[man] I don't want to get into that.

1637
01:38:55,804 --> 01:38:59,558
Do you think, as a scientist,
I am happy to have been in Sochi?

1638
01:38:59,641 --> 01:39:03,187
And to everything...
We gave credibility to the lab.

1639
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:05,647
Do you think that I feel good today?

1640
01:39:05,731 --> 01:39:08,900
Do you think that the athletes
who were cheated feel good?

1641
01:39:08,985 --> 01:39:12,989
[Fogel] As angry as you guys might be,
I think the one thing...

1642
01:39:14,991 --> 01:39:19,328
Grigory risked his life,
and is risking his life, to do this.

1643
01:39:19,411 --> 01:39:22,873
He left his wife behind,
he left his children behind,

1644
01:39:22,957 --> 01:39:26,669
he left all of his belongings behind,
all of his financial security behind.

1645
01:39:27,586 --> 01:39:30,131
We're here to get everything out.

1646
01:39:30,714 --> 01:39:31,632
Okay.

1647
01:39:33,175 --> 01:39:35,511
[Fogel]  "Dear Mr. Fogel
and Dr. Rodchenkov,

1648
01:39:35,594 --> 01:39:37,429
the IOC has full confidence

1649
01:39:37,513 --> 01:39:39,931
in the authority
of Professor Richard McLaren

1650
01:39:40,016 --> 01:39:43,310
and respects his judgment
to ensure a comprehensive inquiry.

1651
01:39:43,394 --> 01:39:46,230
We will act swiftly
to take the necessary measures.

1652
01:39:46,313 --> 01:39:49,775
Sincerely yours, Thomas Bach. President."

1653
01:39:51,110 --> 01:39:53,654
[automated voice]
Transferring you to Richard McLaren.

1654
01:39:55,281 --> 01:39:58,034
[McLaren]  You speak of them as being
orders. Are they actually orders?

1655
01:39:58,117 --> 01:40:00,952
Nagornykh is ordering Grigory?
Or ordering the lab?

1656
01:40:01,037 --> 01:40:02,163
Does it matter?

1657
01:40:02,246 --> 01:40:05,916
Yes, Nagornykh is ordering Grigory.

1658
01:40:05,999 --> 01:40:10,629
There's e-mails, like,
explicitly about soccer players.

1659
01:40:10,712 --> 01:40:17,386
There's e-mails explicitly of,
you know, of weightlifters.

1660
01:40:18,804 --> 01:40:20,847
And that essentially were...

1661
01:40:20,931 --> 01:40:24,976
Of rowers, of swimmers...

1662
01:40:25,686 --> 01:40:27,854
where Grigory had found the positive.

1663
01:40:27,938 --> 01:40:31,108
[McLaren]  Then if they are
concerned about it,

1664
01:40:31,192 --> 01:40:35,737
they find the right profile in the bank,
and pick that one out of the bank,

1665
01:40:35,821 --> 01:40:39,533
and they run the analysis on that one?

1666
01:40:39,616 --> 01:40:40,742
You got it.

1667
01:40:40,826 --> 01:40:41,827
[McLaren]  I see.

1668
01:40:42,453 --> 01:40:44,913
If this all can be proved,
it's quite mind-blowing.

1669
01:40:45,497 --> 01:40:48,042
-The sooner I have it, the better.
-Okay.

1670
01:40:48,584 --> 01:40:51,253
[McLaren]  It's important
to a lot of people around the world.

1671
01:40:52,588 --> 01:40:54,256
-[Rodchenkov] We do it now?
-[Fogel] Yes.

1672
01:41:07,811 --> 01:41:11,523
...Russian athletes could not credibly
return to international competition

1673
01:41:11,607 --> 01:41:17,654
without undermining the confidence
of their competitors and the public.

1674
01:41:18,697 --> 01:41:21,908
[man]  They are the pride and joy
of Russian sport.

1675
01:41:21,992 --> 01:41:25,996
But track and field stars,
like pole-vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva,

1676
01:41:26,079 --> 01:41:29,291
won't be going for gold
at next month's Rio Olympics,

1677
01:41:29,375 --> 01:41:32,294
despite having friends in high places.

1678
01:41:34,380 --> 01:41:36,423
[Yelena Isinbayeva speaking Russian]

1679
01:41:37,133 --> 01:41:40,093
This is truly important to us, because...

1680
01:41:41,512 --> 01:41:42,596
[sniffles]

1681
01:41:45,599 --> 01:41:47,100
[audience applauding]

1682
01:41:53,064 --> 01:41:56,943
Today, our track and field team
finds itself in a dire situation.

1683
01:41:57,027 --> 01:41:59,488
We have been banned from the Olympics

1684
01:41:59,571 --> 01:42:02,408
very aggressively,
without any evidence or proof.

1685
01:42:07,120 --> 01:42:10,291
[man in Russian] Rodchenkov,
director of the Moscow WADA lab,

1686
01:42:10,374 --> 01:42:12,626
was forced to resign from his position

1687
01:42:12,709 --> 01:42:17,339
even though, when you think about it,
he was a brilliant doctor.

1688
01:42:17,839 --> 01:42:22,261
So he's fired, and then somehow
ends up in the United States,

1689
01:42:22,344 --> 01:42:25,306
where he subsequently took his story
to  The New York Times.

1690
01:42:25,389 --> 01:42:28,684
Not exactly the smallest paper on Earth.

1691
01:42:28,767 --> 01:42:30,769
He gets there,
he turns over all this information.

1692
01:42:31,353 --> 01:42:34,356
Finally, he stated
that the entire doping program

1693
01:42:34,440 --> 01:42:36,608
was in fact part of a state-run system.

1694
01:42:36,692 --> 01:42:39,903
Whatever he claims,

1695
01:42:40,654 --> 01:42:43,324
he is confusing himself
with the government.

1696
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:48,370
You see, all of his claims against
the government, he did himself.

1697
01:42:48,454 --> 01:42:50,121
It was a solo act.

1698
01:42:50,206 --> 01:42:53,459
So the swapping,
the destruction of samples,

1699
01:42:53,542 --> 01:42:55,836
this was all just a farce?

1700
01:42:55,919 --> 01:42:58,755
Again, I just don't see
how this is possible. How could it be?

1701
01:42:58,839 --> 01:43:00,131
Please let me repeat,

1702
01:43:00,216 --> 01:43:03,552
these allegations are not facts,
just rumors and speculations.

1703
01:43:06,513 --> 01:43:08,557
[woman in English]  Welcome
to the McLaren Independent Commission

1704
01:43:08,640 --> 01:43:10,309
news conference here in Toronto.

1705
01:43:11,352 --> 01:43:15,606
In May, Professor McLaren was mandated
by the World Anti-Doping Agency

1706
01:43:15,689 --> 01:43:17,733
with respect to the allegations made

1707
01:43:17,816 --> 01:43:21,320
by the former director
of the WADA-accredited Moscow laboratory,

1708
01:43:21,403 --> 01:43:23,572
Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov.

1709
01:43:25,198 --> 01:43:29,661
The investigation has established
the findings set out in the report

1710
01:43:29,745 --> 01:43:31,622
beyond a reasonable doubt.

1711
01:43:32,206 --> 01:43:33,916
Our experts were to determine

1712
01:43:33,999 --> 01:43:38,086
if samples had scratches and marks
on the inside of the bottle caps,

1713
01:43:38,169 --> 01:43:41,298
representative of a tool used
to open the cap.

1714
01:43:42,549 --> 01:43:45,636
Of the set of samples suspected
of being swapped...

1715
01:43:47,220 --> 01:43:48,764
we were able to confirm...

1716
01:43:50,432 --> 01:43:53,310
100% had evidence of tampering.

1717
01:43:55,437 --> 01:43:57,814
We've conducted cyber
and forensic analysis,

1718
01:43:57,898 --> 01:43:59,858
secured data from hard drives,

1719
01:43:59,941 --> 01:44:03,111
and reviewed thousands of pages
of documents.

1720
01:44:03,945 --> 01:44:09,075
The Moscow laboratory operated for
the protection of doped Russian athletes

1721
01:44:09,701 --> 01:44:13,955
within a state-directed, fail-safe system.

1722
01:44:16,082 --> 01:44:20,462
Ministry of Sport,
Deputy Minister of Sport Yuri Nagornykh,

1723
01:44:20,546 --> 01:44:24,007
RUSADA, that's the anti-doping agency
in Russia,

1724
01:44:24,090 --> 01:44:27,553
and the former director
of the Moscow testing laboratory

1725
01:44:27,636 --> 01:44:30,096
were all involved in this operation

1726
01:44:30,681 --> 01:44:33,475
with the active participation
and assistance

1727
01:44:33,559 --> 01:44:37,521
of the Russian Federal Security Service,
formerly known as the KGB.

1728
01:44:38,397 --> 01:44:41,900
The FSB, who had access to the Sochi lab

1729
01:44:41,983 --> 01:44:44,235
under the guise
of the building maintenance contractor,

1730
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:46,530
can be identified in the evidence we have.

1731
01:44:47,030 --> 01:44:48,574
Alex Mihailovich, RT.

1732
01:44:48,657 --> 01:44:53,370
Rodchenkov himself is a person who's
under investigation in Russia currently.

1733
01:44:53,454 --> 01:44:54,996
He took off from Russia.

1734
01:44:55,080 --> 01:44:58,083
He seems to be a character
that you really can't rely on,

1735
01:44:58,166 --> 01:45:00,961
and a lot of this relies on Rodchenkov.

1736
01:45:01,044 --> 01:45:03,339
Does this compromise your work?

1737
01:45:03,422 --> 01:45:06,091
He is a person in this investigation,

1738
01:45:06,174 --> 01:45:08,677
but not the only person
in this investigation.

1739
01:45:09,260 --> 01:45:13,974
I can say without a doubt,
Dr. Rodchenkov is telling the truth

1740
01:45:14,057 --> 01:45:16,477
and was a truthful witness.

1741
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:18,729
I was able to corroborate that

1742
01:45:18,812 --> 01:45:21,815
because of all the scientific
and forensic information.

1743
01:45:22,858 --> 01:45:28,780
My team can demonstrate the existence
of this system beyond a reasonable doubt.

1744
01:45:42,753 --> 01:45:45,464
[Reedie]  It was clear
from Richard McLaren's report

1745
01:45:45,547 --> 01:45:48,091
that was contained
in our independent commission,

1746
01:45:48,174 --> 01:45:50,677
it's proven that offenses were committed.

1747
01:45:50,761 --> 01:45:55,098
So, I don't think anybody can accuse us
of sitting back and doing nothing.

1748
01:46:00,270 --> 01:46:02,606
[man]
President Putin condemned the findings,

1749
01:46:02,689 --> 01:46:05,484
saying the world is seeing
a dangerous recurrence

1750
01:46:05,567 --> 01:46:07,193
of politics interfering in sport.

1751
01:46:07,903 --> 01:46:09,279
[man]  Russia's government says

1752
01:46:09,362 --> 01:46:13,867
any decision which collectively punishes
its competitors is unacceptable.

1753
01:46:13,950 --> 01:46:15,619
Richard Conway, BBC News.

1754
01:46:27,506 --> 01:46:28,799
[sighs]

1755
01:46:41,144 --> 01:46:43,439
I'm gonna be rolling your hands
like that.

1756
01:46:43,522 --> 01:46:45,857
Let me do all of the work.
It makes it easier for everybody.

1757
01:46:47,943 --> 01:46:49,986
[Rodchenkov in Russian]
What were you all doing today?

1758
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:51,572
[Veronika]  We were worrying all day.

1759
01:46:51,655 --> 01:46:54,575
But today,
I was paying for everything, bills, etc.

1760
01:46:54,658 --> 01:46:56,785
[Rodchenkov]
Nika, we will get through this.

1761
01:46:56,868 --> 01:46:58,328
Oh, you have new glasses!

1762
01:46:59,079 --> 01:47:00,288
[Veronika]  Not that new.

1763
01:47:01,790 --> 01:47:04,000
I have some sad news to tell you.

1764
01:47:04,626 --> 01:47:05,461
Yes?

1765
01:47:07,463 --> 01:47:09,881
I am going
into the witness protection program.

1766
01:47:09,965 --> 01:47:11,257
-You are?
-Mm-hmm.

1767
01:47:13,469 --> 01:47:14,803
Why?

1768
01:47:14,886 --> 01:47:18,682
Because the current situation is unclear.

1769
01:47:21,017 --> 01:47:22,811
-So, this is serious?
-Yes.

1770
01:47:23,562 --> 01:47:24,813
For a while?

1771
01:47:30,486 --> 01:47:32,571
I was thinking of you yesterday.

1772
01:47:32,654 --> 01:47:34,114
Well, visa is just one thing, but--

1773
01:47:34,197 --> 01:47:37,158
You are my bride
and keeper of the family and the dogs.

1774
01:47:37,242 --> 01:47:41,997
Grigory, I was worrying all day,
and on top of that, trying to reach you.

1775
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:43,081
Don't tell anyone anything.

1776
01:47:43,749 --> 01:47:46,960
Who would I even tell?
I don't see much of anyone these days.

1777
01:47:47,043 --> 01:47:52,465
Maybe they'll pay off some officials
to sit in prison for some time?

1778
01:47:52,549 --> 01:47:55,176
As a formality.

1779
01:47:55,260 --> 01:47:57,053
I have to get going.

1780
01:47:58,179 --> 01:47:59,848
-Veronika?
-Yes?

1781
01:47:59,931 --> 01:48:06,437
You wrote down the lawyer's contact
information and have everything?

1782
01:48:07,439 --> 01:48:08,940
You know what I'm talking about?

1783
01:48:12,736 --> 01:48:16,072
Of course I understand.
It's just... This is all so sad.

1784
01:48:29,502 --> 01:48:32,631
[man in English] Whatever packing
you need to do and getting dressed...

1785
01:48:32,714 --> 01:48:34,090
[Rodchenkov] Okay. Okay.

1786
01:48:44,768 --> 01:48:46,186
[speaking indistinctly]

1787
01:48:51,316 --> 01:48:54,027
[Fogel] So, do we know
what, uh, you're gonna be able to...

1788
01:48:54,110 --> 01:48:57,989
[Rodchenkov] I still don't know
how it will be organized.

1789
01:48:58,073 --> 01:49:01,785
"Protection" means protection
that you don't know how it's organized.

1790
01:49:03,620 --> 01:49:05,914
[Fogel] What do you foresee at this point?

1791
01:49:07,791 --> 01:49:09,626
I will start writing book. [chuckles]

1792
01:49:10,836 --> 01:49:12,713
Oh, we are on the first floor.

1793
01:49:13,589 --> 01:49:14,756
Where is the exit?

1794
01:49:21,512 --> 01:49:24,474
I wonder when I'm going to see you again.

1795
01:49:25,809 --> 01:49:27,978
Don't worry. I'll be back. [laughs]

1796
01:49:32,315 --> 01:49:36,778
[laughing] Bryan,
you are medium-sized monster!

1797
01:49:36,862 --> 01:49:38,154
Remember me.

1798
01:49:38,238 --> 01:49:39,280
[inaudible]

1799
01:49:58,174 --> 01:50:02,888
We have decided today
that Russian athletes can compete in Rio.

1800
01:50:06,599 --> 01:50:09,185
[Thomas Bach]  The International Sports
Federations

1801
01:50:09,269 --> 01:50:13,940
will carry out individual analysis,
taking into account...

1802
01:50:20,196 --> 01:50:23,283
[woman]  Anti-doping officials are fuming.

1803
01:50:23,366 --> 01:50:26,912
The IOC going against the World
Anti-Doping Agency recommendations...

1804
01:50:26,995 --> 01:50:29,331
-[starter gun sounds]
-[crowd cheering]

1805
01:50:33,669 --> 01:50:36,629
[man]  ...Olympic champion.
Vlasov had won gold again.

1806
01:50:59,235 --> 01:51:03,156
[Rodchenkov]  "Winston sank his arms
to his sides

1807
01:51:03,239 --> 01:51:06,076
and slowly refilled his lungs with air.

1808
01:51:12,165 --> 01:51:16,169
His mind slid away into
the labyrinthine world of doublethink.

1809
01:51:18,046 --> 01:51:20,423
To know and not to know,

1810
01:51:20,506 --> 01:51:26,096
to be conscious of complete truthfulness
while telling carefully constructed lies."

1811
01:51:26,888 --> 01:51:27,848
[announcer]  Thomas Bach.

1812
01:51:27,931 --> 01:51:31,226
[Rodchenkov]  "To repudiate morality
while laying claim to it.

1813
01:51:37,565 --> 01:51:40,986
To forget whatever
it was necessary to forget..."

1814
01:51:42,612 --> 01:51:45,949
[Bach]  Join and support
our fight for fair play.

1815
01:51:46,032 --> 01:51:50,871
Respect the rules, play fair, be clean.

1816
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:54,374
[Rodchenkov]  "...then to draw it back
into memory again

1817
01:51:54,457 --> 01:51:56,709
at the moment when it was needed..."

1818
01:51:56,793 --> 01:51:59,712
[Bach]  This decision is about justice.

1819
01:51:59,796 --> 01:52:03,299
Justice has to be independent
from politics.

1820
01:52:05,010 --> 01:52:06,636
Hurrah!

1821
01:52:06,719 --> 01:52:09,514
[crowd] Hurrah!

1822
01:52:09,597 --> 01:52:12,142
[Rodchenkov]  "...and then promptly
to forget it again."

1823
01:52:17,688 --> 01:52:20,483
[man]  Fails a drug test,
is stripped of the gold medal...

1824
01:52:20,566 --> 01:52:24,737
[Rodchenkov]  "...and above all, to apply
the same process to the process itself."

1825
01:52:24,821 --> 01:52:26,656
[man]  Trying to make sure
your testimony's clear.

1826
01:52:26,739 --> 01:52:31,036
How many times do I have to say it?
I've never taken drugs. How clear is that?

1827
01:52:31,119 --> 01:52:33,496
[man] Okay. I think it's clear.

1828
01:52:33,579 --> 01:52:36,082
[Rodchenkov]  "And if all others
accepted the lie,

1829
01:52:36,166 --> 01:52:39,127
then the lie passed into history
and became truth."

1830
01:52:40,420 --> 01:52:42,630
[in Russian] We've never had
a doping program in Russia.

1831
01:52:42,713 --> 01:52:47,260
This is just impossible, unthinkable.
We would never do something like that.

1832
01:52:47,343 --> 01:52:50,847
I don't even recall the name
of that citizen who defected,

1833
01:52:50,931 --> 01:52:55,268
the one who ran
the Russian anti-doping lab.

1834
01:52:55,351 --> 01:52:57,979
[Rodchenkov in English]
"Even to understand the word 'doublethink'

1835
01:52:58,063 --> 01:53:00,606
involves the use of doublethink."

1836
01:53:00,690 --> 01:53:03,734
[McLaren] We are now able to put
the findings of the first report

1837
01:53:03,819 --> 01:53:05,904
into sharper and clearer focus.

1838
01:53:05,987 --> 01:53:11,242
I can confirm, for years,
that spectators have been deceived.

1839
01:53:12,202 --> 01:53:13,744
The desire to win medals

1840
01:53:13,829 --> 01:53:18,249
superseded their collective moral
and ethical compass, and Olympic values...

1841
01:53:18,333 --> 01:53:20,668
[Rodchenkov]  I was doing
in parallel two things

1842
01:53:20,751 --> 01:53:24,714
which canceled out each other
in being fully contradictory.

1843
01:53:30,303 --> 01:53:31,930
Doping and anti-doping.

1844
01:53:36,684 --> 01:53:40,105
It was pure, exact doublethink.

1845
01:53:44,817 --> 01:53:46,444
I was like a slave.

1846
01:53:49,906 --> 01:53:51,574
Slavery was my freedom...

1847
01:53:56,579 --> 01:53:57,914
till the end.

1848
01:54:11,511 --> 01:54:12,637
So...

1849
01:54:17,142 --> 01:54:18,101
truth.
